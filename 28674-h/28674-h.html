<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The social institutions, manners, and customs of an ancient
people must always be of deep interest for all those to
whom nothing is indifferent that is human. But even for
modern thinkers, engrossed in the practical problems of our
advanced civilization, the records of antiquity have a direct
value. We are better able to deal with the complicated
questions of the day if we are acquainted with the simpler
issues of the past. We may not set them aside as too
remote to have any influence upon us. Not long ago men
looked to Greece and Rome for political models. We can
hardly estimate the influence which that following of antiquity
has had upon our own social life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is a deeper influence even than Greek politics
and Roman law, still powerfully at work among us, which
we owe to a more remote past. We should probably resent
the idea that we were not dominated by Christian principles.
So far as they are distinct from Greek and Roman
ideals, most of them have their roots in Jewish thought.
When a careful investigation is made, it will probably be
found that the most distinctive Christian principles in our
times are those which were taken over from Jewish life,
since the Old Testament still more widely appeals to us
than the New. But those Jewish ideas regarding society
have been inherited in turn from the far more ancient Babylonian
civilization. It is startling to find how much that
we have thought distinctively our own has really come
down to us from that great people who ruled the land of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the two streams. We need not be ashamed of anything
we can trace back so far. It is from no savage ancestors
that it descends to us. It bears the <span class="tei tei-q">âhall mark,â</span> not only
of extreme antiquity but of sterling worth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people, who were so highly educated, so deeply
religious, so humane and intelligent, who developed such
just laws, and such permanent institutions, are not unprofitable
acquaintances. A right-thinking citizen of a modern
city would probably feel more at home in ancient Babylon
than in mediÃ¦val Europe. When we have won our way
through the difficulties of the language and the writing to
the real meaning of their purpose and come into touch with
the men who wrote and spoke, we greet brothers. Rarely
in the history of antiquity can we find so much of which we
heartily approve, so little to condemn. The primitive virtues,
which we flatter ourselves that we have retained, are
far more in evidence than those primitive vices which we
know are not extinct among us. The average Babylonian
strikes us as a just, good man, no wild savage, but a law-abiding
citizen, a faithful husband, good father, kind son,
firm friend, industrious trader, or careful man of business.
We know from other sources that he was no contemptible
warrior, no mean architect or engineer. He might be an
excellent artist, modelling in clay, carving rocks, and painting
walls. His engraving of seals was superb. His literary
work was of high order. His scientific attainments were
considerable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we find so much to approve we may naturally ask
the reason. Some may say it is because right was always
right everywhere. Others will try to trace our inheritance
of thought. At any rate, we may accord our praise to those
who seized so early in the history of the race upon views
which have proved to be of the greatest and most permanent
value. Perhaps nowhere else than in the archives of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the old Assyrian and Babylonian temples could we find
such an instructive exhibition of the development of the
art of expressing facts and ideas in written language. The
historical inscriptions, indeed, exhibit a variety of incidents,
but have a painful monotony of subject and a conventional
grandeur of style. In the contracts we find men struggling
for exactness of statement and clearness of diction. In the
letters we have untrammelled directness of address, without
regard to models of expression. In the one case we have a
scrupulous following of precedent, in the other freedom
from rule or custom. One result is that while we are
nearly always sure what the contract said and intended, we
often are completely unable to see why the given phrases
were used for their particular purpose. Every phrase is
technical and legal, to a degree that often defies translation.
On the other hand, the letters are often as colloquial in
style as the contracts are formal. Hence they swarm with
words and phrases for which no parallel can be found.
Unless the purpose of the letter is otherwise clear, these
words and phrases may be quite unintelligible. Any side
issue may be introduced, or even a totally irrelevant topic.
While the point of these disconnected sentences may have
been perfectly clear to the recipient of the message, we cannot
possibly understand them, unless we have an intimate
acquaintance with the private life and personal relations of
the two correspondents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, quite apart from the difficulties of copying such
ancient inscriptions, often defaced, originally ill-written,
and complicated by the personal tastes of individual scribes
for odd spellings, rare words, or stock phrases; besides the
difficulties of a grammar and vocabulary only partly made
out; the very nature of both contracts and letters implies
special obscurities. But the peculiarities of these obscurities
are such as to excite curiosity and stimulate research.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wholesome character of the subject-matter, the absence
of all possibility of a revision in party interests, the probable
straightforward honesty of the purpose, act like a tonic
to the ordinary student of history. Nowhere can he find
more reliable material for his purpose, if only he can understand
it. The history he may reconstruct will be that of
real men, whose character and circumstances have not yet
been misrepresented. He will find the human nature singularly
like what he may observe about him, once he has
seen through superficial manners and customs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One important point cannot be too strongly insisted upon.
Numerous as our documents are, they do not form a continuous
series. One collection is chiefly composed of temple
archives, another comes from a family deed-chest, where
only such documents were preserved as were of value to the
persons who collected them. At one period we may have a
great number of documents relating to one sort of transaction.
In the next period we may have hardly any reference
to similar transactions, but very complete evidence regarding
other matters. We may assume that, in such a conservative
country as Assyria or Babylonia, things went on for
ages in much the same way. Conclusions rightly drawn for
early times are probably true for the later periods also. As
far as we can test this assumption, it holds good. We may
even assume that the converse is true, but that is more
doubtful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, we find that the practice of taking a pledge as
security for debt is fully established for later times and we
may therefore hesitate to deny its existence in early periods,
although we have no direct evidence on the point. This
absence of evidence may be due to the nature of the early
collections. It may be an accident. It may also be due to
the fact that the tablet acknowledging a loan was usually
broken up on the return of the sum. But it might also be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the fact that pledges were not usual in early times. Such
was, indeed, formerly the conclusion drawn from the absence
of documents referring to pledges; but Dr. B. Meissner
pointed out that the legal phrase-books bore witness
to the existence of the custom. The discovery of the Code
of á¸¤ammurabi has shown that the practice not only existed,
but was regulated by statute in his time. Hence the argument
from silence is once more shown to be fallacious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, it is well to avoid a dogmatic statement
of the existence of a practice before the date at which
we have direct evidence of it: thus, it has been stated that
the tithe was paid in Babylonia <span class="tei tei-q">âfrom time immemorial.â</span>
The only direct evidence comes from the time of Nebuchadrezzar
II. and later. In view of such an early antiquity
as that, the use of the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">âtime immemorialâ</span> was perhaps
once justified. But we are now equipped with documentary
evidence concerning customs two or three thousand
years earlier. Until we can discover some direct evidence
there of tithe, we must content ourselves with saying that it
was regularly paid under the Second Empire of Babylonia.
We may be firmly convinced that a custom so widespread
did not spring into being all at once. But the tithe may have
been a composition for earlier dues, and as such may have
been introduced from Chaldea by Nabopolassar. It may
therefore not have been of native Babylonian growth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this and many similar cases it is well not to go beyond
the evidence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To some extent the plan of this work must necessarily be
different from that of the rest of the series. When a historical
inscription is once well translated its chief bearings
can be made out and it is its own interpreter to a large extent.
But the object in a contract is to legally bind certain
parties to a course of action, and there its translation ends.
We do not find much interest now in the obligations of these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parties, save in so far as they illustrate the progress of civilization.
It is the conclusion we are to draw which gives
the interest. When we have reached that, a thousand more
contracts of the same type add nothing to that point. We
may use them to make a study of proper names, or to correct
our notions of chronology by their dates, or to draw up
genealogies, or even to elaborate statistics of occurrences of
particular forms of words, of prices, and the like; or try to
reconstruct the topography of a town; but from the point
of view of a student of law and history, a thousand are
little better than one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a rule, however, we rarely find a fresh example of an
old type without some small deviation, which is worth recording.
But to translate it, for the sake of that small
difference, would fill a book with examples, so similar as to
be wearisome in their monotony. The only way then is to
select some bold example, translate it as a fair average
specimen, and then collect in an introduction and notes the
most interesting additional items of information to be
gathered from others of the type. Hence most of the types
here selected have involved the reading and study of scores
of texts, though but one is given in translation. Other
points of great interest arise, as for example, the obligations
to public service, which are not the direct subject of
any one text. Hence, no single example can be selected for
translation. The data of many texts must be collected, and
only a sentence here and there can be utilized for translation.
Hence, while other volumes of the series are properly
translations, with brief introductions and a few notes, this
must consist of copious introductions and many notes with
a few translations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of course, all technical, philological and historical discussions
must be avoided. Those who wish to find further
examples, illustrating the points given, will be referred to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sources and commentaries which give almost endless
repetitions of the same type. As a rule, a fresh example,
which has not been translated before, will be used here. In
some cases, however, where the most typical examples have
already been used, they are reproduced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more important and new details are substantiated
by references in foot-notes. When several references could
be given, it has been the rule to give only one. For fuller
information the literature of the subject may be consulted.
But where the Assyrian or Babylonian words are given,
the reader will consult the lexicons first. There are many
admirable glossaries attached to the editions of texts, which
for students are a valuable supplement to the lexicons. All
philological discussions are, of course, excluded. As a rule,
doubtful interpretations will be ignored or at least queried.
It is, on the other hand, impossible to give detailed proofs
of what is certain to the writer, when it disagrees with
recognized authorities. Nor is it desirable to puzzle the
reader with alternative views, when there is no opportunity
for him to judge of their merits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every attempt will be made to discard non-essentials.
Thus, in order to insure that there should be no mistake as
to the persons intended, the ancient scribe usually gave not
only the name, but the father's name, and often added the
name of his tribe, or his occupation. For example, <span class="tei tei-q">âArdi-Ishtar,
son of Ashur-bÃ¢nÃ®, the son of Gaá¸¥al,â</span> might be the
scribe's careful specification of one party to some transaction.
But unless some other party is a relation and the
transaction explicitly concerns what could take place between
relations, the whole line gives us no information of value
for illustrating the subject for which it is quoted. Indeed,
in most cases, the name itself is of no interest. It is true
that the names have a value of their own; but that is aside
from the purpose of this book. The examples are selected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to illustrate legal points, not for the sake of the names.
And indeed, the few interesting names so given would be
insufficient to serve any useful purpose; they might even be
misused, for no permanent results can be obtained by picking
up here and there a name, with some fanciful likeness to
Abraham, or Jacob, unless a complete list of similar names
be available to check and control the readings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, as a rule, the name of a party is condensed into
a single letter, chosen usually in order to suggest the part
played by the person in the transaction. Thus S stands for
the seller, B for the buyer, J for the judge, C for the creditor,
L for the lender, D for the debtor or borrower, and so
on. These abbreviations may be used without any detriment
to the argument, as the context usually defines the relation
and there is no need to remember what they mean. This
seems preferable, for the most part, to the Continental system
of using A-A-G for the above name.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a further abbreviation, all lists of witnesses are excluded.
The date is usually suppressed, for, unless we are following
a series of transactions between the same parties, nothing
more than the epoch is of importance. As the material is
arranged by epochs, there can be no question in this regard.
If any evolution of process or any reference to former transactions
is involved, so that the date is important, it is given.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A collection of legal documents may be studied in a
variety of ways.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the least productive plan is to ransack them for
illustrations of a theory, or a particular point. When the
theory is already well known, as in the case of Roman or
mediÃ¦val law, such a procedure is justifiable, but when the
theory has to be made out, it is wellnigh inexcusable.
Some valuable monographs have followed this method, but
they can hardly expect to give permanent results. For
comparative purposes our material is so new, and so little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worked, that it is sheer waste of time to seek for parallels
elsewhere until everything is clearly made out to which
parallels are to be sought. The whole bulk of material
must be read through and classified. Until this is done,
some important point may easily be overlooked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first attempts at classification will be provisional. A
certain amount of overlapping is sure to occur. For example,
slave sales obviously form a provisional group. But
slaves were sold along with lands or houses. Shall these
sales be taken into the group? The sales of lands may be
another group. To which group shall we assign the sale of
a piece of land and the slaves attached to it? To answer
that question we may examine the sales of slaves and the
sales of lands to see if either group has peculiarities, the
recurrence of which in a sale of land and slaves might
decide. But we soon find that a slave was sold exactly like
a piece of land or any chattel. The only exception is that
certain guarantees are expected with the slave, which differ
from those demanded with a piece of land. On the whole,
then, the chief group will be <span class="tei tei-q">âsales,â</span> with subdivisions
according to the class of property used. Hence we cannot
assume that there was already present to legal consciousness
a difference between real and personal property, or in any
other sense that a slave was a person. He was a chattel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The classification which will be adopted is not one that
will suit modern legal ideas. It depends on the form of
document alone. If two documents have the same type of
formula, they will be grouped together. A future revision
will, no doubt, assign to many of these a place in modern
schemes. But it is very easy to be premature in assigning
an ancient document to modern categories.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The groups will be subdivided according to subject-matter.
The order of the groups will be determined by the
greater or less complexity of the documents. It is best to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvi">[pg xvi]</span><a name="Pgxvi" id="Pgxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
take those first which can be easily made out. The experience
gained in discussing them will be of great service in
dealing with more complicated cases. The reader must not,
however, suppose that no obscurities will remain. Subsequent
investigation will lead to redistribution. Each such
revision will, however, bring us nearer to sound results.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most interesting and instructive methods of
dealing with a large collection of documents is to group
together the transactions, distributed over a number of
years, of one man, or of a single family. This method has
often been adopted and makes most fascinating reading.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, M. V. Revillout, in the appendix to M. E. Revillout's
lectures entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les obligations en droit egyptien</span></span>,
under the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Une famille des commerÃ§ants</span></span>, discussed
the interrelations of a large number of tablets published by
Strassmaier. These had a special connection, being found,
and practically kept, together. They are concerned chiefly
with the business transactions of three persons and their
descendants. The three men do not seem to have been
related, but to have become partners. The first transaction
in which they are concerned is an equitable division of property
which they had held in common. They and their descendants
lived side by side in Larsa and gradually extended
their possessions on every side. They were neighbors to two
wealthy landowners from whom and from whose descendants
they gradually acquired lands and houses. Especially did
two brothers, sons of one of the original three, buy up, piece
by piece, almost all the property of these two neighboring
families. Further, in acquiring a piece of land, they seem
to have come into possession of the deeds of sale, or leases,
of that plot, which had been executed by previous owners.
Thus, we can, in some cases, follow the history of a plot of
land during several reigns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such a collection of documents probably did not come
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvii">[pg xvii]</span><a name="Pgxvii" id="Pgxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the public archives, but from the muniment-chest of a
private family, or of a firm of traders. That duplicates of
some of these tablets should have been found in other collections,
points either to the collections having been purchased
from native dealers, who put together tablets from
all sources, or to the duplicates having been deposited in
public archives, as a kind of registration of title.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Assyrian times the transactions of the great RÃ®mÃ¢ni-Adadi,
the chief charioteer and agent of AshurbÃ¢nipal, who
for some thirteen years appears almost yearly, as buyer or
seller, lender or borrower, on some forty tablets, may serve
as a further example,<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> or we may note how Baá¸¥iÃ¢nu appears,
chiefly as a corn lender, year after year, for thirty-three
years, on some twenty-four tablets.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the Second Empire of Babylonia, Professor J. Kohler
and Dr. F. E. Peiser have given some fine examples of this
method. Thus, for the bankruptcy of NabÃ»-aplu-iddin,<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
they show that the creditors distrained upon the bankrupt's
property and found a buyer for most of it in a great
Neriglissar, afterwards King of Babylon. The first creditor
was paid in full, another received about half of the amount
due to him, a third about the same, while a fourth obtained
less than a quarter of what was owed him. They
also follow out the fortunes of the great banking firm of
Egibi<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
for fully a century. The sketch, of course, is not
complete, and can only be made so by a prolonged search
through thousands of documents in different museums; but
it is intensely interesting and written with wonderful insight
and legal knowledge. Another example is the family, or
guild, of the priests of Gula.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> This is less fully made out
but most valuable, as far as it goes. In both cases a genealogy
is given extending over many generations.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexviii">[pg xviii]</span><a name="Pgxviii" id="Pgxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Later still, the Babylonian Expedition of the University
of Pennsylvania, in the ninth volume of Cuneiform Texts,
gives a collection of the business documents of one firm,
<span class="tei tei-q">âMurashu Sons, of Nippur,â</span> in the reign of Artaxerxes I.
Here we have to do with a family deed-chest, a collection
of documents found together and fortunately kept together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this method, attractive though it is, cannot be followed
here. The reader is best led on from the known to the unknown.
Those things must be taken first which must be
understood in order to appreciate what is placed later. We
consider first the law and the law-courts. The reader can
thus follow the references to procedure which occur in the
other sections. The rights of the State, the family, and the
private individual come next. Then we learn of the classes
of property and the various ways of disposing of it. After
that is taken up a variety of disconnected topics, whose
order is mainly indifferent. Some overlapping of divisions
is sure to occur in any order. This system has been found,
after many permutations, to present the least inconvenience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While it is hoped that this volume will give a fairly complete
account of what is really known and also point out
some things that are reasonably conjectured to be true, it is
fully recognized that much remains to be done. Indeed, it
may serve by its omissions to redirect attention to openings
for future fruitful work.

The chief sources from which is derived our knowledge
of Babylonian and Assyrian law are the contemporary
inscriptions of the people themselves. These are not supplemented
to any appreciable extent by the traditions of
classical authors. So far as they make any references to
the subject, their opinions have to be revised by the immeasurably
greater knowledge that we now possess, and
seem to be mostly based upon <span class="tei tei-q">âtravellers' talesâ</span> and misapprehensions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These inscriptions are now preserved in great numbers
in European and American museums, and have only been
partly published. The bibliography is very extensive.
For the earlier attempts to read and explain these documents
the reader may refer to Professor C. Bezold's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">KurzgefÃ¤sster
Ãberblick Ã¼ber die babylonisch-assyrische Litteratur</span></span>,<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> which gives a fairly complete account up to 1887. Of
course, many books and memoirs there mentioned have now
only a historical interest for the story of decipherment and
explanation. These, however, may be studied with the
greatest profit after having first become acquainted with
the more recent works.

The division which is adopted in this work, <span class="tei tei-q">âlaw, contracts,
and letters,â</span> is only conventional. The three groups
have much that is common and mutually supplement one
another. Previous publications have often treated them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more or less together, both as inscriptions and as minor
sources of history. Hence it is not possible to draw up
separate lists of books treating each division of the subject.
Only those books or articles will be referred to which are
most valuable for the student. Many of them give excellent
bibliographies of their special subject.

The contemporary sources include actual codes of law, or
fragments of them, legal phrase-books, and legal instruments
of all sorts. From the last-mentioned source almost
all that is known of ancient Babylonian law has been derived.
The historical and religious inscriptions contribute
very little. The consequence is that, except from the recently
discovered Code of á¸¤ammurabi scarcely anything is
known of the law in respect to crimes. Contracts and
binding agreements are found in great profusion; but there
is nothing to show how theft or murder was treated. Marriage-contracts
tell us how adultery was punished. Agreements
or legal decisions show how inheritance was assigned.
Consequently our treatment of law and contracts
must regard them as inseparable, except that we may place
first the fragments of actual codes which exist.

The letters are much more distinct. Each is a separate
study, except in so far as it can be grouped with others of
the same period in attempts to disentangle the historical
events to which they refer. The deductions as to life and
manners are no less valuable than those made from legal
documents. In both wording and subject-matter they often
illustrate legal affairs and even directly treat of them.

The longest and by far the most important ancient code
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hitherto discovered is that of á¸¤ammurabi
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">circa</span></span> 2250 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>).
The source for this is a block of black diorite about 2.25
metres high, tapering from 1.90 to 1.65 metres in circumference.
It was found by De Morgan at Susa, the ancient
Persepolis, in December, 1901, and January, 1902, in fragments,
which were easily rejoined. The text was published
by the French Ministry of Instruction from <span class="tei tei-q">âsqueezesâ</span> by
the process of photogravure, in the fourth volume of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">MÃ©moires
de la DÃ©lÃ©gation en Perse</span></span>. It was there admirably
transcribed and translated by Professor V. Scheil. In all,
the monument now preserves forty-four columns with some
three thousand six hundred lines. There were five columns
more, which were once intentionally erased and the stone repolished,
probably by the order of some monarch of Susa,
who meant to put his own name and titles there. There
have been found other monuments in the French explorations
at Susa, where the Elamite monarch has erased the inscription
of a Babylonian king and inserted his own. This
method of blotting out the name of a king was a favorite
device in the ancient East and is frequently protested
against and cursed in the inscription set up in Babylonia.
This particular inscription did not fail to call down similar
imprecations, which perhaps the Elamite could not read.
But he stayed his hand, and we do not even know his
name, for he wrote nothing on the vacant space.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems probable that the stone, or at any rate its original,
if it be a copy, was set up at Sippara; for the text
speaks of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ãbarra Å¡uati</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âthis Ebarra,â</span> which was the
temple of Shamash at Sippara. At the head of the obverse
is a very interesting picture of á¸¤ammurabi receiving his
laws from the seated sun-god Shamash. Some seven hundred
lines are devoted to the king's titles and glory; to
enumerating the gods he reverenced, and the cities over
which he ruled; to invoking blessings on those who preserved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his monument and respected his inscription, with the
usual curses on those who did the opposite.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> These belong
to the region of history and religion and do not concern us
here. We may note, however, that the king expected that
anyone injured or oppressed would come to his monument
and be able there to read for himself what were the
rights of his case.

The whole of this inscription is not entirely new matter.
The scribes of AshurbÃ¢nipal somewhere found a copy, or
copies, of this inscription and made it into a series of tablets.
Probably their originals were Babylonian tablets, for
we know that in Babylonia the Code had been made into a
series which bore the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">NÃ®nu ilu á¹£Ã®rum</span></span>, from the
opening words of the stele. But, judging from the colophon
of the Assyrian series, the scribes knew that the inscription
came from a stele bearing the <span class="tei tei-q">âimageâ</span> of á¸¤ammurabi.
A number of fragments belonging to such copies
by later scribes were already published, by Dr. B. Meissner<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> and Dr. F. E. Peiser.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> These were further commented
upon by Professor Fr. Delitzsch,<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> who actually gave them
the name <span class="tei tei-q">âCode Hammurabi.â</span> Some of these fragments
enable us to restore one or two sections of the lost five columns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These fragments are now easily set in order and will
doubtless lead to the discovery of many others, the meaning
of which has not yet been recognized. They exhibit some
variants of interest, showing that they were not made
directly from this particular monument. Even at Susa
another fragment was found of a duplicate stele. Hence
we may hope to recover the whole text before long.

The publication of the Code naturally excited great interest
among scholars. It appeared in October, 1902, and,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
during the next month, Dr. H. Winckler issued a German
translation of the Code under the title, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die Gesetze Hammurabis
KÃ¶nigs von Babylon um 2250 v. Chr. Das Ãlteste

of the fourth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jahrgang</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Der alte Orient</span></span>. This marked an advance in some points
on Scheil's rendering, but is not entirely satisfactory. The
present writer read a paper in October, 1902, before the
Cambridge Theological Society, an abridged report of
which appeared in the January <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal</span></span>. He further published
a baldly literal translation in February, 1903, entitled,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Oldest Code of Laws in the World</span></span>.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal
des Savants</span></span> for October and November, 1902, M. Dareste
gave a luminous account of the subject-matter of the
Code, especially valuable for its comparisons with the
other most ancient law-codes. This of course was based
on Scheil's renderings. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orientalistische Litteratur-Zeitung</span></span>
for January, 1903, Dr. H. Winckler, reviewing
the fourth volume of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">MÃ©moires</span></span>, gave a useful account
of the Code comparing it with some of the previously published
fragments.

The comparison with the Mosaic Code was sure to attract
notice, especially as Professor F. Delitzsch had called the
attention of the public to it, in his lecture entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babel
und Bibel</span></span>, even before more of the Code was known than
the fragments from Nineveh. Dr. J. Jeremias has published
a small book called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moses und Hammurabi</span></span>, in which
he deals with the relations pretty thoroughly. Professor
C. F. Kent has also examined them in his article entitled
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Recently Discovered Civil Code of Hammurabi</span></span>, in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Biblical World</span></span> for March, 1903. Some remarks on the subject
are to be found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New York Independent</span></span>, December
11, 18, 1902, and January 8, 15, 22, 1903, accompanying
a translation. All the above follow Winckler's renderings.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The translation here given makes use of the above works,
but must be regarded as independent. It is impracticable
to detail and justify the changes made. The renderings can
hardly be regarded as final, where actual contracts do not
occur to illustrate the Code; but there is very little doubt
that we know the tenor of these laws with substantial accuracy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Professor V. Scheil divided the text of the Code into sections
according to subject-matter. But there are no marks
of a division on the monument and Scheil's division is not
adhered to in this work. For convenience of reference,
however, his original section-numbers are given in connection
with each law or sub-section of a law.

Among the treasures preserved in the library of AshurbÃ¢nipal
and in the archives of the Babylonian temples were
a number of tablets and fragments of tablets which recorded
the efforts made by Semitic scribes to render Sumerian
words and phrases into Semitic. A large number of
these are concerned with legal subjects. A fairly complete
list of those now in the Kouyunjik Collections of the British
Museum will be found in the fifth volume of Dr. Bezold's
catalogue, page 2032. The greater part of them have
been published either in the British Museum <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inscriptions

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sumerische LesestÃ¼cke</span></span>. In the latter will be found references
to other publications. Dr. B. Meissner further published
a number of later Babylonian editions of the same or
allied series.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>

The plan of the series to which most of these tablets
belong is well seen in Dr. Delitzsch's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assyrische LesestÃ¼cke</span></span>,
fourth edition, pp. 112-14. The name by which the
series is usually known, to which most of these tablets
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
belong, is the Semitic rendering of the first Sumerian phrase
given there, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana ittiÅ¡u</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âto his side.â</span>
The sections into which the series is divided each deal with some simple idea
and its expression in Sumerian. But the principle of arrangement
is not very clear. We may take one section for
example. <span class="tei tei-q">âWith him, with them, with me, with us, with thee,
with you,â</span> are given in two columns, the first being the
Sumerian for these phrases, the second the Semitic rendering.
Owing to the form of treatment some of these texts
have been called <span class="tei tei-q">âparadigms.â</span>

But the scribes also gave some fairly long and connected
prose extracts in Sumerian with their Semitic renderings.
What these were extracted from is still a question. Some
of the clauses are known to have been employed in the
contracts. But some of these even may well have been
extracts from a code of laws. The name of <span class="tei tei-q">âSumerian
Family Lawsâ</span> has been given to certain sections.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> Others
seem to have been extracted from a Sumerian work on
agriculture, with which Hesiod's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Works and Days</span></span> has
been compared. But at present we are not in possession
of the complete works from which these extracts are
taken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such as they are, they have a value beyond that of enabling
us to read Sumerian documents. They often afford
evidence of customs and information which we get nowhere
else.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
The information given by them will be utilized in
the subsequent portions of this work. Their translation
here would serve no purpose, since they are very disconnected,
but an example may be of interest. One section
reads, <span class="tei tei-q">âHe fastens the buckets, suspends the pole, and
draws up the water.â</span> This is a vivid picture of the working
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Legal documents constitute by far the larger portion of
the inscriptions which have come down to us from every
period of Babylonian and Assyrian history. In the library
of AshurbÃ¢nipal alone they are exceeded by the letters and
even more by the works dealing with astrology and omens.
In some periods, however, we have only a few inscriptions
from monuments, or bricks.

To some extent the term <span class="tei tei-q">âcontracts,â</span> which has commonly
been applied to them, is misleading. The use of the term
certainly was due to a fundamental misunderstanding, they
being once considered as contracts to furnish goods. They
were even thought to be promises to pay, which passed
from hand to hand, like our checks, and so formed a species
of <span class="tei tei-q">âclay money.â</span> These views were both partially true,
but do not cover the whole ground.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were binding legal agreements, sealed and witnessed.
They were binding only on the parties named in
them. They were drawn up by professional scribes who
wrote the whole of the document, even the names of the
witnesses. Hence it is inaccurate to speak of them as
<span class="tei tei-q">âsignedâ</span> by anyone but the scribe, who often added his
name at the end of the list of witnesses. The parties and
witnesses did impress their own seals at one period, but
later one seal, or two at most, served for all. It is not
clear whose seal was then used. But the document usually
declares it to be the seal of the party resigning possession.

As to external form, most of those which may be called
<span class="tei tei-q">âdeedsâ</span> consist of small pillow-shaped, or rectangular,
cakes of clay. In many cases these were enclosed in an
envelope, also of clay, powdered clay being inserted to prevent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the envelope adhering. Both the inner and outer
parts were generally baked hard; but there are many examples
where the clay was only dried in the sun. The
envelope was inscribed with a duplicate of the text. Often
the envelope is more liberally sealed than the inner tablet.
This sealing, done with a cylinder-seal, running on an axle,
was repeated so often as to render its design difficult to
make out, and to add greatly to the difficulty of reading
the text. When the envelope has been preserved unbroken,
the interior is usually perfect, except where the
envelope may have adhered to it. Such double tablets are
often referred to as <span class="tei tei-q">âcase tablets.â</span> The existence of two
copies of the same deed has been of great value for decipherment.
One copy often has some variant in spelling, or
phrasing, or some additional piece of information, that is of
great assistance. The envelope was rather fragile and in
many cases has been lost, either in ancient times, or broken
open by the native finders, in the hope of discovering gold
or jewels within. But in any case, the envelope, so long as
it lasted, was a great protection; and there are few tablets
better preserved than this class of document.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Assyrian times, few <span class="tei tei-q">âcaseâ</span> tablets are preserved,
they seem to have gone out of fashion except for money-loans
and the like. But it may be merely an accident that
so few envelopes are preserved. In the case of letters,
where the same plan of enclosing the letter in an envelope
was followed, hardly any envelopes have been found, because
they had to be broken open to read the letter. The
owner of a deed may have had occasion to do the same,
but here there was less excuse, as the envelope was inscribed
with the full text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In early times, another method of sealing was adopted.
A small clay cone was sealed and the seal attached to the
document by a reed, which ran through both. The seal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thus hung down, as in the case of many old parchment
deeds in Europe.

The deeds were often preserved in private houses, usually
in some room or hiding-place below ground. In the case
of the tablets from Tell Sifr, which were found by Loftus
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in situ</span></span>, three unbaked bricks were set in the form of a
capital U. The largest tablet was laid upon this foundation
and the next two in size at right angles to it. The
rest were piled on these and on the bricks and the
whole surrounded by reed matting. They were covered
by three unbaked bricks. This accounts for their fine
preservation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Others were stored in pots made of unbaked clay. The
pots, as a rule, have crumbled away, but they kept out the
earth around. Sometimes this broke in and crushed the
tablets. In some cases they were laid on shelves round a
small room; but in others they seem to have been kept in
an upper story, and so were injured, when the floor fell
through.

It seems certain that as a rule all deeds were executed
in duplicate, each party receiving a copy. The scribe
often appears to have kept another. At one time copies
were also deposited in the public archives, most probably
the city temple or the governor's palace. There are indications
that copies of deeds executed in the provinces
were sent to the capital. Whether this was in pursuit of
a general policy of centralization or only accidental in the
few cases known to us is not quite clear. In many instances
we actually possess duplicates, sometimes three
copies of the same deed.

These documents are exceedingly varied in contents.
The most common are deeds relating to the sale or lease
of houses, fields, buildings, gardens, and the like; the sale
or hire of slaves and laborers; loans of money, corn, dates,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wool, and the like; partnerships formed or dissolved; adoption,
marriage, inheritance, or divorce. But almost any
alienation, exchange, or deposit of property was made the
subject of a deed. Further, all legal decisions were embodied
in a document, which was sealed by the judge and
given to both parties to the suit. These were often really
deeds by which the parties bound themselves to accept and
abide by the decisions. Some are bonds or acknowledgments
of debt. A great many closely allied documents are
lists of money or goods which had been given to certain
persons. They were evidence of legal possession and
doubtless a check on demand for repayment.

The bibliography of the subject is best dealt with under
each general division; but reference must be made to works
dealing with the subject as a whole. Professor J. Oppert's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Documents Juridiques</span></span> was the first successful attempt to
deal with contracts in general and laid the foundation of
all subsequent work. Dr. F. E. Peiser and Professor J.
Kohler's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aus Babylonischen Rechtsleben</span></span> deals with the
later Babylonian documents as far as they throw light upon
social life and custom. Professor Sayce's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylonians and
Assyrians</span></span> makes large use of the data given by the contracts.
Dr. T. G. Pinches's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Old Testament in the Light
of the Monuments of Assyria and Babylonia</span></span> also gives a
very full account of what may be gleaned from them. The
present writer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assyrian Deeds and Documents</span></span> makes an
attempt to treat one branch fully. This work can only
present the most essential facts. The whole amount of
material is so vast, so much is yet unpublished, so many
side-issues arise, all worth investigating, that it can only
serve to introduce the reader to a fascinating and wide field
of study.

The material with which we have to deal, for the
most part, falls very naturally into epochs. The early
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Babylonian documents, though very numerous, are mostly
of the nature of memoranda and include few letters or contracts.
The documents of the First Dynasty of Babylon
are extremely rich in examples of both contracts and letters.
Then the Tell Amarna letters form a distinct group. The
Ninevite contracts and letters of the Sargonid Dynasty are
well marked as separate from the foregoing. Lastly, those
of the New Babylonian Empire are a group by themselves.
A few scattered examples survive which form intermediate
groups, usually too small to be very characteristic, and
certainly insufficient to justify or support any theory of the
intermediate stages of development.

It must be observed that to a great extent these groups
are not only separated by wide intervals of timeâseveral
centuries as a ruleâbut that they are locally distinct. The
first comes from Telloh, the larger part of the second from
Sippara, the third from Egypt (or Syria), the fourth from
Assyria, the last from Babylonia. Whether the documents
of Sippara in the third period showed as great divergence
from those of the second period as the Tell Amarna letters
do, or whether each group is fairly characteristic of its age
in all localities using the cuneiform script, are questions
which can only be answered when the other documents of
that period are available for comparison.

The documents of each group have marked characteristics
in form of script, in orthography, in language. So great
are the differences that a slight acquaintance with these
characteristics will suffice to fix the epoch of a given document.
For the most part, however, these characteristics
are not such as can appear in translation. They will be
pointed out as far as possible in the opening sections dealing
with each group. The aim will be to select characteristic
specimens of each group for translation and to append a
summary of what can be obtained by a study of the group.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The thousands of documents dealt with under these groups
would, if translated, require a library of volumes. In the
case of the contracts the repetition of scores of examples of
the same sort would be wearisome. In the case of the letters,
the translation alone would be almost as obscure as the
original, without copious comment on the relationships, customs,
and events referred to. In both cases it must be noted
that many of the most interesting examples are incomplete
and unavailable as specimens. The object of this work is to
show what are the most important laws or legal documents
of each period and to point out the chief subjects of information
to be gained from them. For the letters no such summary
of information can be given, partly because they are so
many and varied, partly because so few are yet available.

The first epoch is to be considered as one period only
because its contribution to the subject is as yet small and
chronologically precedes the first great group. It ranges
from the earliest beginnings of history to somewhere about
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 2300. The dates are largely conjectural, but for the
most part the sequence of the events is known. It is the period
covered by Dr. H. Radau's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Early Babylonian History</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some very ancient documents fall under this period.
The early tablets which show the nearest approach to the
original picture-writing<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> are transfers of property. As a
rule, however, such votive inscriptions do not come under
the head of contracts. One of the earliest of our monuments,
the Stele of Manistusu, King of Kish, records the
sale of land. Another very early monument of similar
style<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>

But by far the greatest number of inscriptions belong to
the finds of Telloh, made by De Sarzec in his explorations
for the French Government. His greatest find, some
thirty thousand tablets which were in the archives there,
was dispersed by the Arabs, and has found its way into
various museums. They have been sold in Europe, as
coming from different localities. It is certain that other
finds of the same period and same general character have
been made elsewhere, so that it is often difficult now to
determine their place of discovery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A very large number of these tablets, from the collection
of T. Simon, now in the Berlin museums, were copied and

harvests from fields, seed and other expenses allowed for
cultivating fields, lists of the fields with their cultivators,
numerous receipts for loans or grants, accounts of sheep and
cattle, stipends or allowances for certain people; but only
one, number 125, is doubtfully said to concern a sale of some
slaves.

A very large number of tablets belonging to the second
period are now in Europe and America. They seem to
have been purchased from dealers, either in the East or
West; and may be presumed to have been discovered by
the natives. No reliable information can therefore be had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as to their origin. Various places are mentioned: Sippara,
Abu Habba, Senkereh, Telloh, Warka, have all been stated
to be the place of discovery. There seems no good reason
why tablets of this period should not be found anywhere in
Babylonia. But on examination it is found that collections
said to be from widely different places contain duplicates;
while the same collection contains tablets dated at different
cities and with dates a thousand years apart. It is conceivable
that the records of important transactions, especially the
transfers of land, were deposited by order in the archives at
the capital, wherever that was for the time being. We may
imagine that the archives at Sippara or Larsa were afterwards
transferred to Babylon, for safety, or in pursuance
of a policy of centralization. Certain it is that a large
number of the texts imply a devotion to Shamash as chief
deity, while others ascribe the pre-eminence to Marduk or
Sin. But this fact is quite consistent with the archives
having been discovered in either Babylon or Sippara.

On the other hand, it is not unlikely that the apparent
centralization is of purely modern production. The dealers
put together tablets from all sources and ascribe the collection
to the place of origin which best suits their fancy. As
a consequence, scarcely any collection contains a homogeneous
series belonging either to one period or source. This is
the more deplorable because so few are competent to date a
tablet by the style of writing upon it, and internal indications
are often lacking.

II. A number of tablets now in the Kouyunjik Collections.

to Warka, but with an implied doubt. One or two
are dated at Erech. The D. T. Collection also contains
many tablets, said to be <span class="tei tei-q">ânot from Kouyunjik.â</span>

The earliest publication of the texts was by Pater J.
N. Strassmaier in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Verhandlungen des V Internationalen
Orientalistischen Congresses zu Berlin</span></span>, 1881. In the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beilage</span></span> he gave the lithographed text of one hundred and
nine tablets under the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die altbabylonischen VertrÃ¤ge
aus Warka</span></span>. He made many important observations
upon their character and style, and gave a valuable list
of words and names. As was to be expected from a first
attempt, both his readings of the texts and his transcriptions
from them leave room for some improvement. He
arranged his texts according to the reigns of the kings
mentioned.

This edition formed the subject of M. V. Revillout's
article, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Une Famille commerÃ§ant de Warka</span></span>, and of numerous

It was followed by other parts and by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylonian and

their full treatmentâphotographs of the originals, drawings,
and descriptions of the seals, transliterations, translations,
and comments, giving a better idea of what these documents
are like than can be obtained without actually handling
the originals. Dr. Pinches in his introduction assigns their
discovery to the ruins of Sippara. The texts published by
him only include three from our period, Nos. 1, 13, 14;
but nowhere will a beginner find more assistance in his
studies of this class of tablet.

transliteration and translation of one hundred and eleven
texts published in autography. Full notes and comments
were added giving practically all that could then be said on
the subject. His introduction summarized the information,
to be extracted from his texts, bearing on the social institutions
of Babylonia. By arranging the texts in classes according
to their purport and contents he was able to elucidate
each text by comparison with similar documents and so
to gain a very clear idea of the meaning of separate clauses,
even when the exact shade of meaning of individual words
remained obscure. Any advance which the interpretation
of these documents may make must be based on his researches
and follow his methods. He gave a useful glossary,
but no list of proper names.

A word of notice must be given to the excellent Guides
published by the trustees of the British Museum. The
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guide to the Kouyunjik Gallery</span></span>, with four autotype plates,

reproductions of the originals, 1900. On pages 104-13
will be found a most useful account of the class of tablet
and short descriptions of ninety-four exhibited case tablets.
Most of these tablets have been published by Strassmaier
or in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cuneiform Texts</span></span>, but are now indicated by their new
registration numbers.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be evident from the above remarks that only a
small proportion of the material in our museums has yet been
published. It is greatly to be desired that every existing tablet
should be published, as in no other way can we hope to
solve many important problems. Not only the chronology
but much of the actual history can be recovered from these
tablets, while the names of the witnesses and parties to the
transactions will settle the order of the years which are still
doubtful. It is from these deeds that the greater part of
this work will be constructed. They form the groundwork,
while later documents fill in details.

The years were given names. Thus the second year of
á¸¤ammurabi is called <span class="tei tei-q">âthe year in which á¸¤ammurabi the
king established the heart of the land in righteousness.â</span>
The year often received its name from the capture of some
city. Are we to suppose that these events actually occurred
on the first day of the year? If not, by what name
was the year called up to the occurrence of the event in
question? There is evidence that some years passed by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
two names, one of which was probably conferred after the
year had begun. An examination of all dated tablets
would doubtless result in fixing the time of the year at
which the new year-name came into use. This can only be
achieved by the custodians of our great collections. But,
speaking generally, it seems obvious that names were often
given to the years which attached to them a memory of
the previous rather than a record for the current year.
When in after years scribes drew up lists of the dates of
a reign, they may well have made mistakes as to the exact
year in which an event took place and have also credited a
king with too long a reign, by counting as separate years
two dates which were really the alternatives for one and
the same year. In this way we may perhaps account for
the discrepancies between the Chronicle and the King
Lists.

The tablets often mention the name of the reigning king
as well as the year-name; thus we read as a date, <span class="tei tei-q">âthe year
when Samsuiluna was king,â</span> followed by <span class="tei tei-q">âthe year in
which the canal of Samsuiluna named á¸¤egallu was dug,â</span>
which was the year-name of Samsuiluna's fourth year.
Also the parties often swore an oath to observe their contract
by the name of one or more gods and of the reigning
king. Hence, very often, when the date is not preserved
at all, we know what reign was concerned. On the other
hand, in some reigns we have dated tablets from almost
every year. If all the tablets were published, the witnesses
and other parties would enable us to fix the sequence of
the years. As these year-names each give a prominent
event for the year we could thus reconstruct a skeleton
history of the reign. Indeed, the present writer had already
determined the order of several years, in more than one
reign, from consideration of the persons named in each. Of
course, no assurance could thus be had that some intermediate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
years were not omitted in such a scheme, since
there is no certainty that we know the name-dates for each
year of a reign. The order of the kings themselves and
the lengths of their reigns were already known from the
King List published by Dr. T. G. Pinches.<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>

It seemed probable that the scribes of those days would
have made lists of the year-names, in order to know
how much time had elapsed since a given event had occurred.
Hence great was the excitement and delight when
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C. T. VI.</span></span> was published a tablet which once contained
a list of year-names from Sumuabu to Ammizaduga. This
was followed by the publication in Mr. L. H. King's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Letters of á¸¤ammurabi</span></span> of a duplicate, which served to
restore and complete the list down to the tenth year of
Ammizaduga's reign. Mr. King further added the year-names
actually used on the dated tablets then published;
thus showing how the year-names of the list were quoted
and either abbreviated or expanded. He very appropriately
called this the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chronicle of the Kings of Babylon</span></span>. In
the meantime Professor A. H. Sayce had given a translation
of the first published list.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> In the fourth volume of the

has given a full discussion of the first published list. He
further adds a small list of the same character giving the
year-names in order for part of the reigns of á¸¤ammurabi
and Samsuiluna.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
Dr. Lindl used the published dates of
the contracts to complete and restore the first list. Thus
a great deal of excellent work has been done on these lists.
None of them are complete for the whole dynasty, nor even
for the part which they originally covered, and the known
dated documents do not serve to fully restore them. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so far as they go, they must take the precedence of the
King List, being almost contemporary documents.

Besides the kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon the
collections above referred to designate several other persons
as kings. Thus the B collection of the British Museum
names NÃ»r-Adadi, Sin-idinnam, and Rim-Sin as kings. The
texts enable us to fix all these as kings of Larsa. Hence
evidently the Tell Sifr, where these tablets were found, was
in the territory of Larsa. The whole question is well discussed
by Dr. Lindl.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> The date on the tablet B. 34a refers
to the setting-up of a throne for Shamash by NÃ»r-Adadi.
The date on B. 35 refers to the completion of a temple in
Eridu by Sin-idinnam, King of Larsa. It is scarcely conceivable
that these refer to other than the NÃ»r-Adadi, who
set up the kingdom of Larsa in the south of Babylonia
about the same time as Sumuabi founded the dynasty of
Babylon. Sin-idinnam, his son, succeeded him as King of
Larsa and claimed to be King of Shumer and Akkad.
Elam, however, under Kudurnanhundi I., invaded the
south, defeated Sin-idinnam and set up Rim-Sin as King
of Larsa. It seems that Rim-Sin reigned thirty-seven
years, partly as vassal of á¸¤ammurabi, from the seventeenth
year of Sin-mubalit until the thirty-first of á¸¤ammurabi.
Whether Sin-idinnam was then restored to his throne as
vassal of á¸¤ammurabi, or whether Rim-Sin was succeeded
by a second Sin-idinnam, or whether the restoration of
Sin-idinnam, after a temporary expulsion of Rim-Sin, took
place within the thirty-seven years of the latter's reign, is
not yet clear.

Of great interest is the fact of the use of an era in the
south of Babylonia. A large number of tablets are dated

used largely, but a few Sumerian phrases remain. All the
names of persons except those of the kings are pure Babylonian.
The determinative of personality before proper names
is common, but not before a king's name. The tablets
are dated by regnal years, no longer by year-names. The
kings have a determinative of divinity before their names.
The money in use is either gold or bronze, silver is hardly
named, while in other epochs it is almost always used.

If subject to Assyria, their date may be before the earliest
eponyms whose date is known from the Canon lists.
They may be contemporary with the very earliest kings of
Assyria. But it is not impossible that the eponyms referred
to were local only and not Assyrian in origin. Dr. Peiser
put them after the First Dynasty of Babylon, but before
the Third Dynasty.

They are full of unusual forms of words and have a
phraseology of their own. They cannot as yet be translated
with any confidence. In general they are very similar
to the contracts, money-loans, and letters of the First
Dynasty of Babylon. As far as they can be understood,
they offer no new features of interest. The obscure phrases
and words give rise to many speculations which will be
found in the above-mentioned works. These are of great
interest, but need further data for elucidation. They are
too questionable to be profitably embodied here.

In external form they closely resemble the Babylonian
documents of a similar nature. They are drawn up in practically
the same way. But there is a blunt directness about
them which recalls the usages of the First Dynasty of Babylon,
rather than Assyria, or the Second Babylonian Empire.

They have many peculiar words and phrases. Some may
be Elamite, or that form of Semitic which obtained in Elam,

The legal documents of Assyria are in many respects a
separate group. They are sometimes said to have come from
the library of AshurbÃ¢nipal, which Mr. H. Rassam claims
to have discovered at Kouyunjik in 1852-54. But it seems
far more probable that, as large numbers were already found
by Layard in 1849-51, we have rather to do with the contents
of some archives. The absence of any large number
of temple-accounts seems to exclude the probability that they
were connected with a temple; but the fact that nearly every
tablet has for one principal party some officer of the king,
lends great probability to the view that the transactions
were really made on behalf of the king; orâto be more exactâof
the palace in Nineveh. The exceptions may be
accounted for as really deeds concerned with former sales;
or mortgages of property, finally bought in for the king.
The conjecture is raised to a moral certainty by the contents
of such a collection as Knudtzon's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gebete an den Sonnengott</span></span>,
found together with them; which consisted of
copies of the requests and inquiries made of the Sun-god
oracle regarding the troubles and difficulties of the king and
royal family, domestic as well as public, in the reigns of
Esarhaddon and AshurbÃ¢nipal. The letters too, found in
the same collection, are the letters received by the king
from his officers in all parts of his realm. The lists are
connected with expenses of his household. Such votive
tablets as are preserved are concerned with offerings of the
royal family, or such high officers as probably were permanent
inmates of the palace. We have, in fact, the contents
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the muniment chests of the Sargonid kings of Assyria.
That the royal library was mixed up with these documents
may be due to the contents of an upper chamber falling,
when its floor was burnt out; but the mixing may have
been done by the discoverers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a very real sense these come from a record office, but
are confined to royal rather than state documents; though
a few duplicates of charters occur. Hence we look in vain
for many classes of documents, such as are common in the
archives of temples or private families. We have no marriage
settlements, no adoptions, no partnerships.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Can we believe that such transactions were less common
in Nineveh than fifteen centuries before in Sippara, or
Larsa, or Babylon; or later in Babylon, Sippara, or Nippur?
There cannot be a shadow of doubt that such documents
exist in shoals somewhere in the ruins of Nineveh
and will one day be found. Hence we must regard it as
extremely improbable that the ordinary citizens of Nineveh
contributed the records of their transactions to the Kouyunjik
Collections now in the British Museum. They
either kept them in their own houses or in some temple
archives. As will be seen later, a few have already been
found; but it is extremely difficult to locate them exactly.
It is quite certain that a few of the tablets in the British
Museum were found at other localities, such as Sherif
Khan, Ashur, Kalah, Erech, Larsa, and Babylon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the most part these appear to have been placed in
one collection by the discoverers, and only internal evidence
can now decide where they were found. But the great bulk
of the Kouyunjik Collections, as far as contracts, legal documents,
and kindred tablets are concerned, are the result of explorations
conducted on the site of the ancient Nineveh, by
Layard and Rassam. They probably came from palace archives,
and as a result possess a special character of their own.

Aramaic dockets very early attracted the attention of
Assyriologists. The presence of short inscriptions in
Aramaic on a few contract-tablets naturally raised hopes,
in the early days of decipherment, of finding some check
upon the reading of cuneiform. So far as these went
they were by no means inconsistent with the readings of
the cuneiform. But they were too few, too disconnected,
and in themselves too uncertain, to be of great value.
Indeed, for many of them, it is the cuneiform that now gives
the key to their possible sense. The whole of these Aramaic
inscriptions have now been published by Dr. J. H.
Stevenson in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assyrian and Babylonian Contracts with

In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assyrian Deeds and Documents</span></span> the same plan of
arrangement was followed, to some extent, as in this work.
Being all of one epoch and showing no signs of any development
the tablets were grouped, provisionally, according to
subjects. The arrangement in each group was to place first
the best specimens of the group and then the injured and
fragmentary specimens, which thus received illustration,
and in some cases, could be restored. It would, however,
be an error to regard the Assyrian documents as the intermediate
link between the old and new Babylonian documents,
though they belong chronologically to an interval
which precedes the latter immediately. The Assyrian
scribe used a formula that was closer to the Old Babylonian
than to the contemporary Babylonian. It had
an independent development, looking rather to the royal
charters as models than to the private document. In fact,
the closest parallels of all are to be found on the Babylonian
boundary-stones and charters. When, therefore, in
our chronologically arranged sketch of a given subject,
reference is made to Assyrian usage, next to that of the
First Dynasty of Babylon, it will be understood that only
the nature of the transaction is akin; and that, as a rule, the
verbal treatment of it is quite distinct.

written monuments, there is no time of which we can say,
<span class="tei tei-q">âAs yet there was no law.â</span> Our chief object to-day is to discover
what the law was. For the most part, and until lately,
we were compelled almost entirely to infer this from such
contracts as were drawn up between parties and sworn to,
witnessed, and sealed. Among them were a large number
of legal decisions which recorded the ruling of some judicial
functionary on points of law submitted to him. These and
the hints given by the legal phrase-books had allowed us
to attain considerable knowledge of what was legal and
right in ancient Babylonia or Assyria.

But the question remained, Was it <span class="tei tei-q">ârightâ</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">âlawâ</span>?
Were there enactments by authority, making clear what was
right, and in some cases creating right, where there was none
before? There was much to suggest the existence of enacted
law, even of a code of laws, and the word <span class="tei tei-q">âlawâ</span> had been
freely applied. But there was no known ascription of
any law to a definite legislator. There was no word for
<span class="tei tei-q">âlaw,â</span> only the terms <span class="tei tei-q">âjudgments,â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âright,â</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">âwrong.â</span>

We definitely know of one great code of laws, that of
á¸¤ammurabi, and we are greatly strengthened in the view
that there were laws, and even codes, centuries before him.
The way in which contracts quote the phrases of his code is
exactly parallel to the way in which far earlier contracts
quote phrases which are evidently extracts, in the phrase-books,
from some connected work. Hence we are warranted
in thinking that these extracts come from a Sumerian code
of laws. We do not yet know to whom we should ascribe
its compilation.

For the Code of á¸¤ammurabi is also a compilation. He
did not invent his laws. Phrases found in them appear
in contracts before his time. Doubtless he did enact some
fresh laws. But he built for the most part on other men's
foundations. The decisions already passed by the judges
had made men ready to accept as <span class="tei tei-q">ârightâ</span> what was now
made <span class="tei tei-q">âlaw.â</span> But the question is only carried back a stage
further. Did not those judges decide according to law? In
some cases we know they did, for we have the law before
them. When we try to penetrate further into the background
of history we can only surmise. Documents fail us

But we have now a very high antiquity for laws recognized

That laws were already enacted in the pre-Semitic or Sumerian
days we may regard as certain. The legal phrase-books
drawn up by later scribes, especially those known as
forming the series called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana ittiÅ¡u</span></span>, give as
specimens certain laws. These were evidently given by the scribes as examples
of connected prose in Sumerian, accompanied by a rendering
into Semitic. Their object was primarily grammatical,
or at any rate educational; but they are most valuable because
they contain specimens of the Sumerian legislation.
Owing to their limited scope they were at first regarded as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
family laws. But there can be little doubt that they really
are extracts from something like a code of laws. We are
as yet quite ignorant of the date of their first promulgation,
place of origin, and legislator. The seventh tablet of the
series <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana ittiÅ¡u</span></span>, Col. III. l. 22 to Col. IV. l. 22,
gives the seven following laws:

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Repudiation of father by son</span></div></div>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
I. If a son has said to his father, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">â</span><span style="font-size: 90%">You are not my father,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">â</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> he may
brand him, lay fetters upon him, and sell him.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be doubted whether this applies to any but
adopted sons. <span class="tei tei-q">âYou shall not be my fatherâ</span> is a possible rendering.
But the phrase may only refer to rebellious conduct.
The word rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âbrandâ</span> has often been taken to mean
<span class="tei tei-q">âshave.â</span> The cutting short of the hair was a mark of degradation.
The Semitic Babylonians wore their hair long, while
slaves, and perhaps also Sumerians as a race, are represented
as hairless. However that may be, the same word is used of
<span class="tei tei-q">âbrandingâ</span> cattle and it implies cutting or incision. It may
mean a tattooed mark. The word rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âfetterâ</span> seems
also to be used of a branded body-mark. The whole law
means that the rebellious son is to be degraded to the status
of a slave and treated as such.

one shall brand his forehead, drive him out of the city, and make him
go out of the house.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here the same ambiguity about branding is found. Some
take the word rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âforeheadâ</span> to mean the hair of the
head. His head would then be shaved. <span class="tei tei-q">âTo go out from
the houseâ</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">âto be cut off from kith and kin.â</span> But
here the son retains his freedom, only he is an exile and
homeless. In this case it is not the mother who exacts the
penalty. The verb is plural and may be taken impersonally.
The family or the city magistrates are probably the ones to
execute the law.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here the father has power to repudiate a son, who must
go. The word for <span class="tei tei-q">âleaveâ</span> is literally <span class="tei tei-q">âtake himself up,â</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">âgo up out of.â</span> The word <span class="tei tei-q">âyardâ</span> is simply <span class="tei tei-q">âinclosureâ</span>
and may mean the city walls, as a symbol of shelter.

</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here we expect, by analogy with Laws I. and II., that this
penalty is rather less than that in III. The <span class="tei tei-q">âpropertyâ</span>
means <span class="tei tei-q">âhouse furniture.â</span> The son must leave home and can
take no house furniture with him. He has no claim to
inherit anything. But he need not leave the city. Hence
it seems likely that III. denied him the right of city shelter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The contrast in the penalties is startling. Note the impersonal
form of V. The executioners here are the family,

It is not a private quarrel, but a refusal of conjugal rights.
In the second case the man divorces, or puts away, his wife,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here the Sumerian text differs from the Semitic. In the
former the employer is said to <span class="tei tei-q">âcauseâ</span> the slave to suffer
these detriments, in the latter he is said to come by them.
The verb rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âlostâ</span> is used in that sense in the later
Code of á¸¤ammurabi. What is the exact sense of the verb
rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âhas been incapacitatedâ</span> is not clear. Professor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hommel<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> renders <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">durchbrennen</span></em>, Delitzsch<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> renders <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">weichen,
entweichen, oder zu arbeiten aufhÃ¶ren</span></em>. But it is clear that the
employer is to pay a daily fine for injury done to the slave,
or for loss to his owner, caused or connived at by him. The
slave's refusal to work could not be made the ground for
fining him. If anyone paid for that it would be the owner.
The employer pays for his work, but is bound to keep
him safe and treat him reasonably well and return him in
good condition to his owner. In later times the owner often
took the risk of death and flight, but then he probably
charged more hire. At any rate it is clear that the owner
is not named in this law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not profitable to discuss these mere fragments of a
code. The most interesting thing is their existence. We
may one day recover the Code in full. These are not retranslations
into Sumerian, by learned scribes, of late laws. For
exactly these words and phrases occur in the contracts of the
First Dynasty of Babylon, before and after the Code of á¸¤ammurabi,
which deals with the same cases, but in different
words. In fact, this Sumerian Code is quoted, as the later
Code was quoted, in documents which embody the sworn
agreement of the parties to observe the section of the Code
applying to their case. This is indeed the characteristic
of the early contracts: after indicating the particulars of
the case, an oath is added to the effect that the parties
will abide by the law concerning it. Even where no reference
is made to a law, it is because either no law had
been promulgated on the point, or because the law was understood
too well to need mention. Later this law-abiding
spirit was less in evidence and the contract became a private
undertaking to carry out mutual engagements. But even
then it was assumed that a law existed which would hold the
parties to the terms of an engagement voluntarily contracted.

This is not the place to write a commentary on the Code,
but there are a few necessary cautions. One of the first is
that most clauses are permissive rather than positive. The
verb <span class="tei tei-q">âshallâ</span> is not an imperative, but a future. Doubtless
in case of heinous crimes the death-penalty had to be
inflicted. But there was always a trial, and proof was
demanded on oath. In many cases the <span class="tei tei-q">âshallâ</span> is only
permissive, as when the Code says a widow <span class="tei tei-q">âshallâ</span> marry
again. There is no proof that the jury decided only facts
and found the prisoner guilty or not, leaving the judge no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
option but to inflict the extreme penalty. The judge, on
the contrary, seems to have had much legislative power.
When this view is taken, the Code appears no more severe
than those of the Middle Ages, or even of recent times, when
a man was hanged for sheep-stealing. There are many humanitarian
clauses and much protection is given the weak
and the helpless. One of the best proofs of its inherent
excellence is that it helped to build up an empire, which
lasted many centuries and was regarded with reverence
almost to the end.

Very little is yet known regarding later Babylonian law.
Dr. F. E. Peiser published in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sitzungsberichte der
KÃ¶nigliche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin</span></span> (1889,
pp. 823 ff.) a very interesting fragmentarily preserved text
(82-7-14, 988, in the British Museum), which contains
either a collection of abstracts of cases which have been
decided, or precedents, or else an extract from some code
later than that of á¸¤ammurabi. Dr. Peiser thought that
the date was the second year of AshurbÃ¢nipal, king of
Babylon. This seems rather unlikely, but may, of course,
be true.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In his inaugural dissertation, Dr. Peiser, under the title
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jurisprudentiae Babylonicae quae supersunt</span></span>, commented
upon and illustrated the above text by numerous examples
of cases, actually occurring during the period of the second
empire. But the whole collection of fragments of law with
which he had to deal was too small to do more than show
what may be hoped for as the result of future discoveries.

the conveyance made out to B, of course paying C; or had
lent money to C, in the name of B; and the transaction
had been completed, by sealing the deed of sale or bond;
then B was the owner of the field, or house, or the creditor
for the loan. A could not plead that he was the real owner,
even if he had not been able to recover the purchase-money
or loan from B, in whose name he had made it. B, whose
name appeared in the deed or in the bond, was the rightful
owner.

How long after sale objection could be raised is not
stated. In early times a month was allowed for fever to
develop; in Assyrian contracts a hundred days were allowed
for fever or seizure. But a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sartu</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-q">âvice,â</span> could be
pleaded, at any time, as ground for returning the slave.
Here it is clear that time was allowed for a slave to bear one
or more children, before the repudiation lost effect. It is
noteworthy that the seller had to buy back such children.
The maid may have been bought to bear her master children,
and if these were not sound, the master had ground for
complaint and could not be held responsible for them. Also
it was objectionable to separate mother and children. The
price named is trifling. Compare Â§ 278 of the Code, where,
however, no mention is made of the children of a maid.

The father here named appears to be the father of the
bridegroom. He must make a settlement on his son, as
well as the father of the bride on his daughter. The point
of the law seems to be that these settlements on the part of
the parents to the young couple are irrevocable. No subsequent
engagements entered into can affect them. This settlement
by the bridegroom's father on his son, which he has
to pay over to the bride's father, evidently takes the place
of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terá¸«atu</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-q">âbride-priceâ</span> of the Code. The obligation
of a father to find his son the means for a bride-price appears
in the Code, Â§ 166; but there is no section which
answers directly to this law. The marriage-portion is now

of all the father once had, but of what is left after these

The slave was at his master's command and, like a child
in his father's house, to some extent a chattel. He could
be pledged for debt, as could a wife or child. He was

The Code reveals the existence of a class of men, who
were indeed known from the letters of á¸¤ammurabi and the
contemporary contracts, but whose functions are not easy
to fix. They were the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rÃ®d á¹£Ã¢bÃ®</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ¢Â´iru</span></span>. By their
etymology these titles seemed to mean <span class="tei tei-q">âslave-driver,â</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">âcatcher.â</span> But the Code sets them in a clearer light. They
were closely connected, if not identical, officials. They had
charge of the levy, the local quota for the army, or for public
works. Hence <span class="tei tei-q">âlevy-masterâ</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">âwarrant-officerâ</span> are
suggestive renderings. For the former official, <span class="tei tei-q">âtaskmaster,â</span>
the one over the gang of forced laborers and reminiscent of
the old time press-gang officers, is a fair translation. <span class="tei tei-q">âField
cornetâ</span> would perhaps suit the military side. For some
aspects of their office the ancient <span class="tei tei-q">âreeveâ</span> may be compared.
Whether the <span class="tei tei-q">âcatcherâ</span> actually was a local policeman,
whose chief duty was to apprehend criminals and reluctant
conscripts, is not yet clear. The same name is used of
<span class="tei tei-q">âfishermen,â</span> who were <span class="tei tei-q">âcatchersâ</span> in another sense, and of
hunters. A really satisfactory rendering is impossible, as
we have now no officials whose duties actually correspond
to theirs.

Each of these officials held what may be called a benefice,
or perhaps a feoff. It consisted of land, house, and garden,
certain sheep and cattle as stock, and a salary. It was directly
ascribed to the king as benefactor. We may compare the
Norman lords settled in England by the Conqueror, or the
Roman soldier-colonists. The men may well have been the
followers of the first founder of the dynasty. In a very
similar way the Chaldean conqueror, Merodach-baladan II.,
long after, settled his Chaldean troops in Babylonia. We may
regard these men as retainers of the king, and probably as
originally foreigners. The benefice was held by them for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
personal service. They were to go <span class="tei tei-q">âon the king's errandâ</span>
when ordered. It was a penal offence to send a substitute.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
The errand might take them away from home and detain
them a very long time. In such enforced absence the official
might delegate his son to take his place and carry on his
duty.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> This implies that there was a local duty besides the
personal service. Further, this needed a grown man to discharge

about by his absence giving the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">locum tenens</span></span> opportunity
to acquire a prescriptive right, which he might do in three

<span class="tei tei-q">âfortress,â</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">âdefeat.â</span> The
word has both meanings. It does not really matter.
Either way the official is captured by the enemy of the
king. He was bound to pay for his own ransom, if he had
the means; or if not, his town must ransom him and, failing
that, the state. But he could not raise money on his
benefice. Moreover, while it could descend to his son, it
was inalienable. No diminution by bequest to his female
relatives, no sale of part of it, no mortgage on it, nor even
its exchange for other like estate, was allowed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further, the official and his benefice were protected. He
could not be hired out by his superior officers, nor in any
way plundered or oppressed. He held tax free, subject
only to his feudal duty.

two officials. No duty is set down for him, beyond that
implied in his name of paying a tribute. It is not clear
that all land was held on one or the other scheme, but it is
so in parts of the East still. Some land is held by personal
service, some on payment of a tax. This tax later became
the tithe. The personal service was later compounded for
by furnishing a soldier or two for the army. The liability
to serve in the levy continued to be borne by slaves and the
lower classes.

That all land did owe either personal service, or tax, is
probably to be deduced from Â§ 40, where we read that
though a levy-master, warrant-officer, or tributary could
alienate nothing of their holdings, other land-owners could
do so. But they did so subject to the buyer taking over
the duty, or service, of the land so transferred. One of the
classes here named, the votary, appears subject to service
elsewhere. The votary of Marduk is expressly exempt
from this service.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> The merchant, who represents another

The votary was already known to us from the contracts,
but there was little to fix her functions. As seen in the
Code, she was a highly favored person. Vowed to God,
usually to Shamash at Sippara, or Marduk at Babylon,
there seems little to connect her with the prostitute-votaries
of Ishtar at Erech. She ordinarily lived in the convent, or
<span class="tei tei-q">âbride-houseâ</span> of Shamash. She was given a portion,
exactly like a bride, on taking her vow and becoming the
<span class="tei tei-q">âbrideâ</span> of Shamash. But her property did not go to the
convent. At her father's death, with her consent, her estate
might be administered by her brothers, or she could
farm it out. At any rate, she was provided for during
her lifetime. But at her death, unless her father had specially
given her power to bequeath it, her property went
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
back to her family. She was not, however, doomed to
spend all her days in the convent. She could leave it and
even marry. But she was expected to maintain a high
standard of respectability. For her to open a beer-shop or
even enter one for drink was punished by burning. She
remained a virgin, even if married. She could have no
children and must provide her husband with a maid, if he
wished to have a family. But she was carefully guarded
from any reproach as childless. She ranks as a married
woman, even if unmarried, and is protected from slander.
Many noble ladies, and even kings' daughters, were votaries.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>

The merchant continually appears. Some passages suggest
that he was a state official. But this is really pressing
far the interest which the state took in him. He was,
doubtless, like the Jew of the Middle Ages, a valuable asset
to the king. He seems to have been the usual moneylender,
so much so that in many places <span class="tei tei-q">âmerchantâ</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">âcreditorâ</span> are interchangeable. A man is usually said to
borrow of <span class="tei tei-q">âhis merchant,â</span> as we say <span class="tei tei-q">âof his banker.â</span>
Doubtless, the king also borrowed from him. It is certain that
the Code was very lenient to him. But the merchant also
did business in the way of ordinary trade. As a capitalist
he sent out his travellers and agents with goods far and
wide, even into domains where the king's authority did not
reach. Much of the Code is occupied with regulating the
relations between the merchant and his agent. The agency
was that form of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">commenda</span></span> which is so characteristic of the
East at the present. The agent takes stock or money
of his principal, signs for it, agrees to pay so much profit,
and goes off to seek a market, making what profit he can.
There is much to suggest that the merchant was not usually
a Babylonian. In later times, the Arameans were the
chief merchants, and travelled all over Mesopotamia, Palestine,
Syria, and into Asia Minor.

Partly because specific references to judges and legal
processes are not necessarily to be expected in historical inscriptions,
and partly because we do not really know which
are the earliest monuments of the race, it is impossible
to decide when law-courts first came into existence. It is
generally admitted, however, that the stele of Manistusu
is one of the earliest known monuments. There we read
of Galzu, a judge. There also we find many of the officials,
who later acted as judges upon occasion. Hence it may
fairly be said that judges were to be found in ancient
Babylonia from time immemorial. They must have decided
what was right when there was no written law to
which to appeal. With the judges were associated as assessors
the elders of the city. This was so marked a feature,
that in some cases we read, that after hearing the complaint
the judge <span class="tei tei-q">âassembled the cityâ</span> to hear the case. In Babylonia
the maxim, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">littera scripta manet</span></span>, was so well understood
that hardly anything of importance was done without
committing it to writing. Hence we are as well informed
about domestic affairs in Babylonia as about those of
Europe in the Middle Ages.

It seems best to consider legal usages first, because they
are essential to the understanding of all others. When
we have a simple contract between two parties we do not
at once see where the reference to the law comes in. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the contract was not valid unless sealed and witnessed.
The sealing was accompanied by an oath. The oath probably
had to be made in court. The witnesses seem often
to have been a body of men who could only be found at
the court. Even when there is least trace of the law and
the judge, the case is similar to others where the judge appears
explicitly. It is also worthy of remark that, partly
owing to our possession of the Code and partly owing to
the fuller nature of the legal decisions, we know far more
of this subject, as of many others, in the early periods than
in the later. Hence the discussion of early legal usage is
unusually full. When the evidence from later times merely
supports this, it will not be noticed. Only divergences
are worthy of record. As a rule, the procedure changes
very little for many centuries.

police administration. We may argue from analogy in
other countries and ages, but this is not a theoretical treatise

For the most part judges constituted a distinct profession,
but it must not be understood that they had no other
means of livelihood. Indeed, there is no hint anywhere
that they received any remuneration for their services. But
it was a high honor and by no means subsidiary to another
office. Among those who officiated as judges we find most
of the higher officials. Doubtless the king himself acted
as judge on occasions, and probably no great official of
the realm was wholly free from the call to act in a judicial
capacity. But, as a rule, the judge is simply noted as
<span class="tei tei-q">âjudge.â</span> That the priests were judges is quite unproved.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The judges were men of great importance and high rank,
but there is nothing to show that they were priests. An
age qualification is more likely.

The judge was a professional man. We often find a man,
bearing the title <span class="tei tei-q">âjudge,â</span> acting as party to a suit, or witness
to a deed, when he is certainly not acting in his judicial
capacity. To a certain extent he was a territorial officer,
had his own district for jurisdiction, and was jealous
of cases being taken elsewhere. How the ranks of the
judges were filled we do not know, but there is a hint of
royal appointment in the phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">âthe king's judges.â</span> On
the other hand, there is clear evidence of the office being
hereditary. Thus, Ibik-AnunÃ®tum had no less than three
sons, Idin-Ishtar, Marduk-mushallim, and Nannar-idinnam,
all judges. Whether a right to the office descended in the
female line is not quite clear, but we find a lady, Ishtar-ummu,
among the judges, on occasion. She was also the
scribe.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Scribes.</span></span>âThe scribe exercised his craft as a profession.
One often meets with a scribe, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tupÅ¡arru</span></span>, acting in a
private capacity, as party to a suit, or as witness. He retains
the title even when the deed is drawn up by another writer.
The class was very numerous. Almost every document is
drawn up by a fresh scribe, so far as the scribe's name is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

He wrote the whole of the document, including the
names of the witnesses. There is no evidence that anyone
else ever wrote a word on the document. As a rule, even
when the names of the fathers of the witnesses are given,
the scribe is content to write only his title after his name.
Hence we have no evidence whether the office was hereditary
or not.

Women certainly were scribes. Out of a total of ninety
names of scribes known, at least ten were women. Here a
difficulty arises from the way in which women's names occur.
At this period proper names are usually written without
the determinative which marks sex. Nor do the names
decide, for both men and women bore the same name.
Thus Taribatum is the name of two men and also of two
women. Only when the title <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tupÅ¡arru</span></span> is given, is the
feminine determinative prefixed to that. We have, however,
ten clear examples.

The scribe was not a judge. It may be true that he
sometimes acted as judge or became one, but then the
higher office overshadowed the lower. He was no longer
scribe but judge. A judge may sometimes have written
down his legal decision and so acted as scribe, but we have
no evidence of such a case. The judge seems never to have
dispensed with the services of the scribe.

the same man may have acted both as scribe and priest.
But the offices are distinct and no one man ever bears both
titles. That in later times the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">amÃªlu</span></span> RID, whose title

peculiar nature of the documents. These concern transactions in
which the property of the temple, or of its officials, was in
question, and one of the college of priests attached to that
temple was charged with the duty of notary where temple
interests were concerned. One might as well say that
every clerk in the Middle Ages was a priest, because all
the deeds of the monastery with which we were dealing
were drawn up by Brother A, whose name was entered in
some monastery list of the brethren as a priest. Whether
the scribes were clerics, and always attached to some temple,
in minor orders, is not clear. On the whole, the evidence
is against this conclusion.

The recurrence of the same names, at the same dates, indicates
that a body of official witnesses were held in readiness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Secondly, we may distinguish the witnesses examined on
oath. It is not clear that these were called by the same

These, of course, were usually not on the jury. They
testified, and were chosen by the parties to the suit. But
the judge might examine persons who, in his opinion,
would know. He selected and sent for them, directing the
parties whom to produce. He might even adjourn the case
for the production of witnesses.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>

Thirdly, we may distinguish the witnesses to a document.
Very often we can discern that these had an interest in the
case. They might be relatives of the parties, neighbors of
the estate in question, officials whose rights were concerned.
In later times they received the special name of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mukinnu</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">âthe establishers.â</span> They may be presumed to have known
at least the general purport of the deed which they witnessed.
When the deed was called in question, they would
be cited to state what they knew. In the case of legal decisions,
both judges and jury occur as witnesses in this
sense. Hence, in a great many cases the distinctions drawn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
above do not hold. Whether the term <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡Ã®bu</span></span> was ever applied
to the third class is doubtful. Their names are usually
preceded by the sign which means <span class="tei tei-q">âbefore,â</span> however
it was read.

4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Cases of dispute settled out of court.</span></span>âWhen parties
disagreed, they might discuss their difference between
themselves and arrive at an agreement. Then they procured
a scribe, who embodied the agreement in a binding
compact, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">duppu lÃ¢ ragÃ¢mi</span></span>. This took the form of a
contract, the parties mutually undertaking not to withdraw
from the agreement, re-open the dispute, or bring legal
action, one against the other. To give sanction to this
agreement, they swore by the gods and the king. Witnesses
were called upon to be cognizant of and attest the
contract; and their names were added to the contract. To
authenticate their names both parties and witnesses often
impressed their seals or, in default of seals, made a nail-mark.
The date was then added. Each party seems to have taken
a copy of the agreement and the scribe held a third, or deposited
it in the archives. Such cases may be said to have
been settled <span class="tei tei-q">âout of court.â</span> At any rate they contain no
reference to a judge, or court. But it is possible that the
administration of the oath was a judicial, or perhaps a sacerdotal
function. Further, the witnesses may have been
drawn from a body of men held in readiness at court to
perform that function. It is certain in some cases, that
agreements arrived at independently were taken to a judge
for confirmation,<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> and the Code expressly directs some
cases to be taken to a judge. But it is probable that many cases
were settled by mutual agreement.

Here may be noted a peculiarity of the scribe's conception
of the case. It will be found that, as he puts the case, the
plaintiff generally loses. This is because the scribe will not
prejudge the case by saying who was right. He writes <span class="tei tei-q">âA
claimed the property of B.â</span> In actual fact it may have
been that B laid claim to what he proved was his. But
that excludes the scribe from saying that B claimed the
property of A, because it never was A's. Hence, writing
after the event, he ascribes the property to the rightful
owner from the start of his document, and regards the
wrongful holder as laying claim to it. Hence, we must not
assume that the parties were not both claimants. In fact,
both parties agreed, as a rule, so far as to submit their case
to a judge. This is clear from the statements which follow
the statement of the cause of dispute. Both parties <span class="tei tei-q">âwent
to the judges,â</span> or rather quaintly, <span class="tei tei-q">âthey captured a judge.â</span>
The preliminary discussion between the parties resulted in
agreement to submit the case to a judge. Both were willing
to abide by the decision. Once, it is true, the plaintiff is
said to have caught the defendant;<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The name of the god by whom men swore is usually given.
As might be expected, the god who figured most prominently
in the Code was Shamash, the chief deity of Sippara,
often associated with his consort, Aia, or Malkatu. Sometimes
the oath was <span class="tei tei-q">âby the king.â</span><a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> Often one or more gods
and the king are named together. When Babylon became
supreme it was usual to swear by Marduk and the local
gods as well. The significance of these oaths for historical
purposes is great, both as indicating political relationships,
and as often affording by the name of the king the
only clew to the date of the document. Mr. King, in his

The purport of the oath was, not to give false evidence,
or, in the case of contracts, not to alter the stipulated agreements.
It is often followed by the words, <span class="tei tei-q">âwhoever shall
alter or dispute the words of this tablet,â</span> evidently a quotation
of the words of the oath; but the consequence of so
doing is not given. Either it was too well known, or too
awful, for the scribe to write it down.

In Assyrian times the oath did not play such an important
part. Still, it was in use occasionally. The oath is
generally found in documents of the grand style, such as
royal charters. Oaths also are of interest for the pantheon
of Assyria.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> A common way of expressing the same
thing was to call on a god to be judge of the case, as for
example, <span class="tei tei-q">âShamash be judge,â</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">âShamash be advocate,â</span>
that is, <span class="tei tei-q">âtake up the case.â</span> So the king's son, or crown
prince, is invoked to be the advocate. An appeal was
also made to the decision of the king. The gods, <span class="tei tei-q">âAshur,
Sin, Shamash, BÃªl, and NabÃ», the gods of Assyria, shall
require it at his handsâ</span> is another way of putting the case.
These examples illustrate the meaning of the older oaths.
There do not seem to be any cases of the witnesses being
put on oath.

But the oath lingered on into very late Babylonian times,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when we have some very full forms. If anyone shall
change or alter the agreement, <span class="tei tei-q">âmay Marduk and Zarpanit

a curse on the same breach of faith in the terms, <span class="tei tei-q">âwhosoever shall
attempt to alter this agreement, may Anu, BÃªl, and Ea curse
him with a bitter curse, may NabÃ», the scribe of Esagila,
put a period to his future.â</span><a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> It is curious thus
to note a recrudescence of old forms in these later times. Was
it merely an antiquarian fashion or had the Persians earlier
come under strong Babylonian influence and preserved
the old forms which had died out in their native home?
The Elamite contracts suggest exactly the same question.
In them it seems evident that Elam, once under Babylonian
influence, adopted and preserved, under native
rulers, forms of which we have no trace in Babylonia, but
which clearly came from that country. Assyria is another
case in point. She kept forms which we know date back
before the time of her independence and which had disappeared
from the contemporary Babylonian documents.
In the later Babylonian times we still find the parties and
the witnesses in a law-court put to the oath.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a>

In Assyrian times the parties usually bound themselves
not to litigate, nor attempt to disturb the settlement made
between them, under heavy forfeits to the treasury of a
god, often tenfold the value of the object in dispute, and
sometimes prohibitive in amount. Such sums as two talents
of silver, or two talents of gold, controvert the idea
that these forfeits were looked upon as possible deposits by
a claimant desiring to reopen the case. They were terrific
penalties intended to deter any attempt at litigation.

The forfeit sometimes took the form of white horses, or
foals (?), which were dedicated to a divinity. Very interesting
is the mention of the dedication of the eldest child to a
god, or goddess. This is worded as if the dedication was to
be by fire. The additional mention of incense or cedarwood,
as accompanying the offering, renders it probable that
it was really meant that the litigant should be punished by
the sacrifice of his child as a <span class="tei tei-q">âburnt offeringâ</span> to the god.
But this only makes it clearer that such penalties were
simply meant to be deterrent. We have no proof that such
an offering ever took place. It was a memory of bygone
horrors, but not less interesting as showing what had once
been possible. A more natural and extremely common
penalty was the payment of a tenfold value to the disturbed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

an example of the multiple restitution so common in the Code.

Something very like an ordeal was occasionally imposed.
The very fragmentary condition of the texts which give it
adds to its obscurity. But it appears to have consisted in
the litigant being compelled to eat a mina weight of some
magically concocted food and to drink the contents of an inscribed
bowl. What the result was expected to be is not
stated. One fragmentary text appears to name the ingredients
of the magic potion. All that can be made out points
to an ordeal, somewhat similar to that inflicted upon a suspected
wife in Numbers v. 12-31.

Foremost we may place the death-penalty. This was
inflicted by the Code for witchcraft, for theft, for corruption
of justice, for rape, for causing death by assault, for neglect
of duties by certain officials, for allowing a seditious assembly,
for causing death by bad building, and for varieties of
these crimes. It is curious that no mention is made of murder
pure and simple. But this is only accidental. It is
evidently assumed. For the Code brings several cases of
murder under this penalty. Procuring the death of a husband
is punished by it; even a fatal assault, as that on a
pregnant woman who dies of miscarriage as the result.
The need of an oath to establish lack of malice in giving a
blow in a quarrel which led to death tends to show that
murder was punished by death, and that it was regarded
as death intentionally caused. An explicit statement was
clearly not needed. We do not yet know how this sentence
was carried out. Usually the Code only says <span class="tei tei-q">âhe
shall be killedâ</span>; by whom, or how, is not stated. For
special cases the manner is described.

Death by drowning was inflicted on a beer-seller for selling
beer too cheaply; on a woman for adultery, for being a
bad wife, for incest, or for desertion of her husband's house.
In every case the victim was a woman. When men were
drowned they shared a woman's fate. In two cases, adultery
and incest, we read of the criminals being bound. In
the latter, Â§ 155, it seems that the man was <span class="tei tei-q">âboundâ</span> and
the woman drowned. In the former, Â§ 129, both were
<span class="tei tei-q">âboundâ</span> and both drowned. It is hardly likely that
<span class="tei tei-q">âboundâ</span> can mean merely tied up, or imprisoned, in the
case of the man who committed incest. I would suggest
that in both cases it means <span class="tei tei-q">âstrangled.â</span> The alternative
would be that the confusion in Â§ 155 is due to the
scribe.

the sin of the hands in striking a father, in unlawful surgery,

of unlawful curiosity. The ear cut off marked the sin of
the organ of hearing and obedience. The tongue was cut

á¸¤anÃ® had killed the shepherds. In the former case he
owed two talents of bronze as fine from each shepherd, in
the latter he had to pay the same amount for each. Either
way, he was held responsible for the value of three hundred
sheep and two talents of bronze for each shepherd.
He and all he had were seized for the liability. It is interesting
to note that his district governor, or the colonel of
the regiment to which he belonged, was thought likely to
liberate him; but some other representative might do so.
The lost property belonged to the king's son. This may
have been Esarhaddon, or one of Sennacherib's other sons.
But, at any rate, it is clear that Esarhaddon was putting

of the court gave a copy to the plaintiff, if not also to the

The kind of points in dispute and decided are, as before,
exceedingly varied. The decisions for the most part illustrate
other subjects rather than the processes in court; but a
few examples may be of interest: A made an advance of
forty-four shekels to B, who pledged a house for it. This
state of affairs continued until both were dead. Their sons
inherited. A's son demanded forty-four shekels of B's son
who refused to pay. Both came before the judges. B's son,
pleaded that the money was never loaned or else repaid long
ago. The judges demanded evidence. Either the contract
or a receipt must be produced. The claimant was able to
present the contract, but no receipt was produced. So the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
judges assigned the claimant a plot of land belonging to the

content to keep the pledge. But it is probable that the debt
was secured on a house which the creditor did not take into
his possession. It is also surprising that the judges did not
order the house to be handed over to the claimant. That
may have been avoided, because of the family rights over
the house. The debtor might thus have been rendered
houseless, or have lost <span class="tei tei-q">âhis father's house.â</span> The widow
may still have been an inmate. A great part of the document
is taken up with the specification of the land handed
over to the claimant. Hence a complete translation is not
given.

The early inhabitants of Babylonia are usually regarded
as a non-Semitic race, whom we term Sumerians. Upon
them was superimposed a layer of Semitic peoples. The
first dynasty of Babylon is now often called Arabian.
But the evidence of a previous admixture of peoples is
not lacking. The subsequent history bears witness to
many invasions by Kassites, Elamites, and nomad tribes,
some Semitic, some probably not. Later came Persians
and Medes, not to speak of Greeks and Parthians.

The foreign wars brought slaves from all the surrounding
countries, even as far away as Egypt. We cannot here
enter into any discussion of the foreign elements in the
population; but it is important to note what the attitude
of the Babylonians was to the foreigners resident in their
midst. The evidence on the whole is very slight. It may
be said, that as a rule, resident aliens became citizens and
were under no disabilities. One section of the Code, if we
correctly understand it, allows an alien to purchase an
estate, provided he bears the liabilities to the state<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a>
which lay upon it. The <span class="tei tei-q">âmerchantâ</span> was probably usually an
alien, and only temporarily resident. In the contracts of
the á¸¤ammurabi period, with the exception of the frequent
West-Semitic names, we have little trace of aliens. When
the Kassites came we may expect the conquering race to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have had full rights. In Assyria there is no trace of
disability. Egyptians, Elamites, Armenians, Jews, Arameans,
contract exactly like natives. In later Babylonian
times we find the same freedom. Of course Persians, and,
later, Greeks, were under no disabilities. Hence there is
very little at any time to chronicle under this head.

Ownership of land carried its liabilities of tax or service.
These were carefully guarded and it was the mark of an
oppressor to exceed the normal demand. That, however,
seems to have been regularly and continually paid. A very
good illustration of public rights over land, or the relation
between the state and the private owner, is afforded by the
construction, in the reign of Cyrus, of a canal of Shamash
by the priest of Sippara. It was to pass through certain
lands and the consent of the owners had to be obtained.
The magistrates and honorables of the city A, through
which it would pass, and the peoples of the neighboring
fields were assembled. They were asked to swear, as Susians,
subjects of the King of Susa, that they would raise
no difficulty. Then the priest took on himself the cost of
the work on the canal, but stipulated that when it was
completed, the neighbors should keep it in repair. Also

Cases concerned with criminal law were naturally not embodied
in contracts. Some cases doubtless may be inferred
from the legal decisions, but these are only where the
penalty had already been commuted from death or punishment
to payment or restitution. They are better taken as
examples of civil law. But this distinction is not the cause
of their rarity or absence. When a man had to be put to
death, scourged, or exiled, there was no need for a written
bond. Hence the only references which we have outside
the Code and the phrase-books, are the penalties set down in
marriage-contracts for conjugal infidelity, or for breach of
contract voluntarily agreed to by the parties to it.

Marriage is the bond which unites the different members
of the family. The married pair, their children, slaves, and
adjuncts, one side or the other, constitute the family unit.
The Sumerian laws presuppose marriage; but, so far as
known, merely attached penalties to repudiation of the
wedded ties. The Code is very full and explicit and forms
the basis of all our knowledge. The contemporary documents
extend it in some particulars. In Assyrian times we
know little or nothing about the laws concerning marriage.
In later Babylonian times very little is known until the
Persian period, when we have many illustrations. But
what we know, or can gather from scattered hints, makes
it clear that the state of things represented in the Code
remained practically unchanged for the whole period.

essentials were that the names of the parties and their lineage
were given, the proper consents obtained and the declaration
of the man that he has taken so-and-so to wife inserted.
As a rule, stringent penalties are set down for a repudiation
of the marriage-tie. In these bonds a man might be required
to insert the clause that his wife was not to be held
responsible for any debts he might have incurred before
marriage. The Code enacts that such a clause shall be held
to act both ways; if it is inserted, then the man shall

The family relationship was of primary importance.
Whatever may be said about traces of matriarchy in Babylonia,
we have no legal documents which recognize the institution.
The father is the head of the family and possesses
full power over his wife and family. But the woman
is not in that degraded condition in which marriage by
capture, or purchase, left her. She was a man's inferior in
some respects, but his helper and an honorable wife.

Not only was the family, which consisted of the wedded
pair and their dependents, a unit, but there was also a connection
with ancestors and posterity which enlarged the
family to a clan or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gens</span></span>. In this sense it often
appears. The family thus constituted had definite rights over its members.
It was very important to a man to be sure of his family
connection. We may note the importance attached at all
epochs to a man's genealogy as distinguishing his individuality.
His family identified him. There was a very large
number of well-marked and distinguished families, which
took their names from a remote ancestor. So far as our
evidence goes, these ancestors were by no means mythical,
but actually lived in the time of the first dynasty of Babylon.
To all appearances they date back <span class="tei tei-q">âto the Conquest.â</span>
Unfortunately no attempt has yet been made to work out
the family histories. But men of such families were the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mÃ¢r bÃ¢nÃª</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-q">âsons of ancestors,â</span> and had special
privileges, which continually emerge into notice. We may compare
the hundred families of China and the patricians of many
nations. There were other families of scarcely less antiquity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and consideration. They do not name their ancestor, but
refer to him as a tradesman. They were sons of <span class="tei tei-q">âthe
baker,â</span> of <span class="tei tei-q">âthe measurer,â</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et cetera</span></span>, with which we may

was a court of ancestry, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®t mÃ¢r bÃ¢nÃ»ti</span></span>, which
investigated questions arising from claims to belong to such families
and which doubtless preserved in its archives the genealogical
lists of these exclusive families. They must have
registered the birth of all fresh members and all adoptions;
for men were adopted freely into such families.

It is not clear whether all members of a family which
traced descent, real or putative, from a trade-father, actually
carried on that trade. If so, we should have examples of a
workmen's guild. Certainly many men who carried on a
trade were <span class="tei tei-q">âsonsâ</span> of the trade-father, but apparently not
all. The Code notes the adoption of a child by an artisan

their quarters. We read of the <span class="tei tei-q">âcity of the goldsmithsâ</span>

It may well be that these guilds were close corporations

The importance of descent was not a sentimental matter
only. The laws of inheritance involved a careful distinction
between proper heirs and a variety of claimants.
Hence it seems likely that there was a registration of births,
deaths, and marriages, at least covering the patrician families.
We have such examples as a man claiming to be of
same father as another, claiming brotherhood. The other
repudiates the claim.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> The tablet is too fragmentary

always had a strong hold over property. Not only was it
for the man's interest to be registered as of a certain family,
but it was also for the family's interest to register all its
members.

There are suggestions that the family assumed certain responsibilities
over the man; for in Assyria it appears that
the family might come forward and liberate a man from his
debt. A free man, who had been sold as a slave to Ashnunnak,
and who escaped to Babylon, after five years, being
claimed as a slave by the levy-masters there, chose to serve
his father's house. His brothers swore by Marduk and
Ammiditana the king, making an irrevocable declaration
that as long as he lived he should take up the duties of his
father's house with his
brothers.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>

was called upon to act as judge in a dispute concerning the
disposition of property.

The suitor came with presents to the parents of the
girl. Most writers see in this a survival of the purchase
of the bride. The name of this gift, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terá¸«atu</span></span>, is
undoubtedly connected with the name of the bride,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mará¸«itu</span></span>. This
present, or bride-price, differed greatly with the circumstances
of the parties. Both money and slaves were given,
but a simple sum of money was more common. In cases
where the bride was rich or highly placed the amount seems
less. A very usual amount was ten shekels, but we have
examples from one shekel up to three minas.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> The Code

Without this bride-price the young man could not take a
wife. Hence it was expressly secured to him by the Code,
if his father died before he was of age to marry, and reserved
as a first charge on the father's estate. There is
some evidence that a woman might make this present to her
future husband. But that may have been because he was
too poor to make it himself and she found him the means.
As a rule, the parents gave this money to the bride. But
we are not in a position to say whether they did so at once,
on the consummation of the marriage, or on the birth of a
child. The suggestion that it was her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Morgengabe</span></span> remains
without support. Certain it is that it was not returned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
always. In the contracts it seems to be given to the bridegroom
with the bride. On a wife dying without children,
the husband was bound to return her marriage-portion to
her family. But if the bride-price which he had given for
her had not been returned to him, he could deduct its value.
On a divorce, he was bound to let his wife have not only her
marriage-portion, but the bride-price paid back to him. If
there had been none, he must give her a fixed sum instead
of it.

From the phrase-books we may gather that there was a
sort of ceremony about presenting the bride-price to the
father: it was placed on a salver and brought in before the
parents.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> This was probably a part of the

If, after he had brought in the bride-price to his prospective
father-in-law, the suitor took a fancy to another girl,
he might withdraw from the suit. But he then forfeited
what he had offered. If this really was the result of having
taken a dislike to a plain girl, we may suppose that
such a maiden might accumulate several bride-prices and so
acquire some wealth. This may explain Herodotus's idea
that the handsome girls made a dowry for the plain ones.
But there is not a shred of evidence for their doing so in
the way he suggests. A girl was a virgin when she was

Women were given in marriage. The suitor for her hand
did not perhaps see her until marriage, but this is not likely,
since he is contemplated by the Code as capable of having
cast his eyes upon another, and so desiring to retreat from
his suit. At any rate, he brought presents to her father,
who accepted or rejected him. There is no hint that
the woman had any choice. The result of this power over
the child's marriage was that conditions might be imposed
on the marriage. The bride might be required to do service
to an existing wife, or to the bridegroom's mother.
Further, the disposal of property was not entirely free after
marriage. It depended upon what the father had laid down
in the marriage-settlement on his daughter. It was strictly
limited to the woman's children, and if there were none it
went back to her father's house.

betrothed girl, or bride, if her marriage were not yet consummated,

to marry. The brothers, when they divided the father's
property, were bound to set aside for him, in addition to his
share of his father's property, a sum for a bride-price, and
take him a wife. It seems probable that men married while
still young and living at home. For the Code contemplates

marriage-portion. If her father was not alive to give it to
her, the duty fell on his heirs, and she had a right to it over
and above her daughter's share of his property. Thus we
find that the brothers, on giving their sister a share, contract
to further endow her if she marries.<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>

extremely well, narrates first what had
been given a notary and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">NU-BAR</span></span> of Marduk by her father
on her taking her vow and entering the temple of Anunitum.
This was his <span class="tei tei-q">âgrantâ</span> to her and was known by the
same name as the marriage-portion of a bride. It included
half a shekel of gold for a nose-ring (?), two shekels of
silver as a finger-ring, another ring of silver of one shekel,
one <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">malumsa</span></span>, three cloaks, three turbans, one small seal
worth five minas, two jewels of unknown character, one
bed, five chairs, five different sorts of things apparently
made of reeds, the concubine Suratum, her step-mother.
Unfortunately many of these renderings are still quite conjectural.
It is interesting to note that the father left to his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
daughter his concubine, who was probably a slave, and possibly
really the girl's mother. But now this girl is about to
marry and her own mother, Shubultum, at any rate, her
father's full wife, together with her brothers and sisters,
give her all this property and cause it to enter her husband's
house. They had a reversionary right to her property,
since as a votary she could not alienate it from her
family.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>

from the Sumerian. It is not always clear who are the actors
referred to, but we may perhaps take it that the officiating
ministers, priests, or elders, first placed their hands
and feet against the hands and feet of the bridegroom, then
the bride laid her head on his shoulder and he was made to
say to her: <span class="tei tei-q">âI am the son of nobles, silver and gold shall fill

your lap, you shall be my wife, I will be your husband.
Like the fruit of a garden I will give you offspring.â</span> Then
there is a wide gap. But in the next column we seem to
have a further part of the wedding-ritual. The officiating
ministers ceremoniously bound sandals on the feet of the
newly wedded pair, gave them a leather girdle (? or strap)
and fastened to it a pouch or purse of silver and gold. The
further ceremony included placing them somewhere in the
desert. Then turning their faces to the sunset and addressing
the man, the minister says: <span class="tei tei-q">âI swear by the great gods
and you may go.â</span> He bids him not to put off the garment
of Ea, nor something belonging to Marduk of Eridu.
Then comes a wide gap, but the fourth column seems to
read <span class="tei tei-q">âuntil you have settled in the house, until you have
reached the city, eat no food and drink no water, taste not
the waters of the sea, sweet waters, bitter waters, the
waters of the Tigris, the waters of the Euphrates, waters
of the well, nor waters of the river, to fly up to heaven
direct not your wings, to burrow in the earth set not your
dwelling. As a hero, the son of his god, let him be pure.â</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The passage is very difficult and much of the rendering
is conjectural, but the point of the address seems to be that
the young man was to go straight home, live with his wife,
and be good, as a true child of God. The first column seems
to be an enumeration of men who are cursed with misfortunes,
for example, <span class="tei tei-q">âone whom his mother brought forth
with weeping,â</span> and perhaps forms part of a prayer that
the bridegroom may not ever be like such men. We must
hope some day to find a fuller text and so to determine
the connection of the various columns. But it is difficult
to imagine what else the text can be than part of a wedding-ceremony.

In the earlier days monogamy prevailed. A man ordinarily

For a variety of reasons men did sometimes have
two wives, but these cases were treated as exceptions. A
man might also have a concubine or a slave-girl to bear
him children. These did not bear legitimate children.
He might adopt them, but was not bound to do so. If a
man married twice, the children of both marriages shared
equally in his possessions; but they did not put their
mothers' marriage-portions into a common fund and divide
that equally. The children of the first wife divided
among themselves their own mother's marriage-portion, and
the children of the second marriage did likewise.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>

a second wife was held to be a slight upon the first, in
whose marriage-contract the clause was inserted that in
such a case the husband must pay her a mina of silver and
allow her to go back to her father's house. In that case
the man was hardly bigamous. It was a case of divorce,
and perhaps a legal ceremony before judges was also necessary.

A man might form a connection with a woman other
than his wife. A concubine was a free woman, but had not
the status of a wife; nevertheless she might bring with her
a marriage-portion, over which she had the same rights as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a legal wife.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> She was taken into the same house as the
wife, but she might not rival her. A man's excuse for taking
a concubine was that his wife was childless. He was
not allowed to take a concubine, even if his wife was childless,
if she gave him a maid to bear him children. Only
when the wife was herself childless and would not allow
him a maid, was he allowed to bring a concubine into his
house. This second wife was married to him. She often
seems to have been bound to serve the first wife and treat
her as her mistress. But she had the same rights as a wife.
If she were put away, the husband had to return her marriage-portion,
if she had any. She had the usufruct of
house, field, and goods. She was not deprived of her children,
but had the custody and education of them. When
they entered into possession of their father's property, she
shared with them, taking the same share as a child. Then
she was free to marry again.<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> It seems that in any case,
the children of a concubine were full children and with the same
standing as the children of the first wife. The father might
dower his daughter for a concubine; she then had no claim
to share with her brothers and sisters at his death.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> But,

The case was different with the maidâa slave who by
her mistress's consent bore children to her master. She
was still a slave and if she rivalled her mistress, or was impertinent
to her, she could be put back again among the
slaves; perhaps even branded. But, if she had borne children,
she was not to be sold as a slave. At the death of her
master she was free. Her children by him were free in any
case. If her master were so minded, he might make them
full sons by verbal acknowledgment. It was enough to
say, <span class="tei tei-q">âmy sons.â</span> But that he had done so probably had to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be proved by a witness. A family unacknowledged by the
father would on his death have only a mother. In such a
family the mother was the obvious ruler. We must be on
our guard against mistaking her position, or that of the
concubine above, for examples of matriarchy. If she was
pledged for debt, she could not be sold, she must be bought
back.

That a slave usually was married to a slave-girl with his
master's consent and even by his direction is quite the rule.
Masters even went so far as to buy a slave-girl to be wife
to a slave. There is no reason to think that the master did
not respect the slave's matrimonial rights. But the slave's
wife was not always owned by the slave's master. Sometimes
she was owned by a different master, or was free.
There was no especial disgrace attaching to becoming the
wife of a slave. A free woman might not only marry a
slave, but bring with her a marriage-portion, as if she had
married in her own rank. The man had no ancestral property,
he was <span class="tei tei-q">âa son of no one.â</span> Hence when he died all
the property to be divided consisted of what the married
couple had acquired together, and the wife's marriage-portion.
To the latter she had full and unquestioned right.
The master was his slave's heir. So the property which
the pair had acquired during their married life was divided

Whenever the mother alone appears, as giving her

the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terá¸«atu</span></span> offered for the girl is small,

Here Elmeshu, daughter of the king Ammiditana, is given
in marriage by Zirtum, also daughter of king Ammiditana,
on the order of her brother, Shumum-libshi. The bridegroom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was Ibku-Anunitum, son of Shamash-limir and
Taram-shullim, his wife. The parents paid for their son
only four shekels as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terá¸«atu</span></span>, which Shumum-libshi and
Zirtum received. If the bridegroom repudiated his bride, he
had to pay half a mina. It is not clear what penalty the
bride had to pay if she repudiated her husband. This is
dated in the reign of Ammiditana; but in which year of
his reign does not appear, as the traces of the year-name do
not agree with any in the Chronicle. It must then have
fallen somewhere between the seventh and the twenty-second
years. Hence the father of the princess was alive
at the time. Why had he no hand in the marriage? The
history of the reign is not very well known. Perhaps he
was away from home. His son and successor, Ammizaduga,
whom we may imagine to have been the eldest son, does
not appear in the case. Perhaps he also was away. But it
is remarkable that the king never does directly take part in
any contract. That is probably due to his sacred character.
The young princess was not treated with overmuch
consideration, judging by the smallness of her dowry.

Meissner deduces from the mention of children that
Taram-Saggil was already married. The exact relation between
the sisters is not clear. In one case they seem to be
daughters of Uttatum, in the other of Sin-abushu. Or it
may be that IltÃ¢ni alone was daughter of Sin-abushu. If
so, perhaps Uttatum had adopted her. Sayce clearly
thinks so. But they might be daughters of the same
mother by different fathers, one of whom is mentioned in
one case, the other in the other. Or they might really be
children of Sin-abushu, if their mother afterwards married
Uttatum, who was thus their step-father. It is clear that
IltÃ¢ni was to wait on her sister, and, if she repudiated her,
was to be treated as a slave. This is exactly parallel to
the status of the slave-maid, whom a wife or votary in the
Code<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> provided for her husband. Perhaps Taram-Saggil
had become a chronic invalid. A comparison of the two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
texts is interesting in other respects. The penalties differ
curiously. If Ardi-Shamash repudiates his wives, in one
case, he loses house and furniture; in the other case, he
pays one mina. Was one the penalty for repudiating
Taram-Saggil, the other for repudiating IltÃ¢ni? But if
they repudiate him, the penalties are different in the two
documents, unless indeed the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">AN-ZAG-GAR-KI</span></span> be an ideogram
for the <span class="tei tei-q">âsteep placeâ</span> from which they were to be

Marriages are not infrequent which impose conditions
upon the husband and wife with relation to outside parties.
Thus a mother gives her daughter in marriage to a man,
on condition that she shall continue to support her mother
as long as she lives. In this case, if the husband put away
his wife, he was to pay one mina of silver; while, if she
hated her husband, she was to be thrown from a pillar,

case is where a lady takes a girl to be wife to her son
but stipulates that the wife shall treat her as mistress.
If she shall say to her mother-in-law, <span class="tei tei-q">âThou art not my
mistress,â</span> she shall be branded and sold. As long as the
mother lives, they two together shall support
her.<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> One
may suspect that such maternal power, as is here shown over
the children, arises from their having been adopted by their
mother in order to provide for her in her old age. This
was often done. The children may have been slaves before
adoption. In the second case, the mother leaves her son all
she has, or may acquire.

her face to leave him and deny him conjugal rights. This
was probably equivalent to desertion. Then a judicial
inquiry was required. If his ill treatment or neglect was

she was bound to be true to her absent husband. If she
entered another man's house, she was condemned to death
as an adulteress.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> But if she was not provided for, she
might enter another man's house without blame.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> There
she might bear children. But, if so, she yet had to go back
to her original husband on his return. The children she
had borne in his absence were to be counted to their real
father.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a>
That the law provides for such cases points to
the existence of frequent wars, in which fortune was not
always on the side of Babylonia.

however, sold as a slave. The Sumerian laws also reserved
to the mother the right to repudiate her son, and he must
quit house and property. The Code gives no such power to
mothers. Indeed, we find examples of a son disputing with
a mother.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a>

Much has been made of the knowledge of writing shown
by the Babylonians and Assyrians. The ability to draw up
deeds and write letters seems at first sight to have been
widely diffused. In the times of the First Dynasty of Babylon
almost every tablet seems to have a fresh <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tupÅ¡ar</span></span>, or
scribe. Many show the handiwork of women scribes.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> But
most of the persons concerned in these documents were of
the priestly rank. There is no evidence that the shepherds
or workpeople could write. In the Assyrian times the
scribe was a professional man. We find <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aba</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tupÅ¡ar</span></span>
used as a title. So, too, in later Babylonian times. The
witnesses to a document can only be said to sign their names
in so far as that they impressed their seals. This was done,
at any rate, in early times. In the Assyrian period the
only parties who sealed were the owners of the property
transferred to a new owner. The whole of a tablet shows
the same handwriting throughout. Anyone who reads carefully
through the facsimile copies in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cuneiform Texts</span></span> can
readily see this. Different scribes, especially in early times,
wrote differently, but this was still the case in Assyrian
days. Yet no change of hand can be noted anywhere in
one document, save where, as in the forecast tablets, a date
or note was added by a different person, often in Assyrian
script, to a text written in Babylonian. The only safe
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
statement to make is that from the earliest times a very
large number of persons existed, at any rate in the larger
towns, who could write and draw up documents.

The use of Sumerian terms and phrases in the body of a
document written in Semitic Babylonian might be ascribed
to a mere tradition. But they were no meaningless formulÃ¦.
The many variations, including the substitution of
completely different though synonymous words, show that
these Sumerian phrases were sufficiently understood to be
intelligently used. In later times they either disappear altogether,
or are used with little variation. They had become
stereotyped and were conventional signs, doubtless
read as Semitic, though written as Sumerian. Our own retention
of Latin words is a close parallel. The First Dynasty
of Babylon was bilingual at any rate in its legal documents,
though the letters are all pure Semitic. The earlier
documents show few signs of Semitic origin, though its influence
can be traced as far back as we can go.

Adoption primarily means a process by which parents
could admit to the privileges of sonship children born of
other parents. There were many reasons which might impel
them to such a course. If they were childless, a natural
desire for an heir might operate. But under the Babylonian
law a man might take a second wife, or a maid, if his wife
were childless, to bear him children. A more operative
cause was that children were a source of profit to their
parents while they remained with them. But it seems that
men married early. Hence this alone does not seem sufficient
to account for the great frequency of adoption. Besides,
in that case, what induced a parent to part with his
child for adoption? It seems that the real cause most often
was that the adopting parents had lost by marriage all their
own children and were left with no child to look after them.
They then adopted a child whose parents would be glad to
see him provided for, to look after them until they died,
leaving him the property they had left after portioning their
own children.

The Code admits all kinds of adoption, but regulates the
custom. A man might adopt an illegitimate son, or the
child of a votary or palace-warder, who had no right to
children, or the child of living parents. In the latter case
alone was the parents' consent necessary. We have examples

Adoption was effected by a deed, drawn up and sealed
by the adoptive parents, duly sworn to and witnessed.
Such contracts definitely state the relationship, which was
in all respects the same as that of a son born in matrimony.
But it laid down the obligations of the son, while it stipulated
what was the inheritance to which he might expect to
succeed. It brought responsibilities to both parties and
fixed them. The son was bound to do that which a son
would naturally have done, explicitly, to maintain his
parents while they lived. The parents were bound, not
only to leave him property, but to treat him as a son. But,
as a rule, all was matter of contract and carefully set down.
If such a contract was not drawn up, although the adoptive
parents had brought him up, the child must return to his
father's house.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a>
Only, for an artisan, it was sufficient to
have taught the child his trade.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So far as our examples go, some color might be given to
the suggestion that adoption was always merely for the convenience
of old people who wanted to be taken care of. But
we know that children were adopted on other grounds.
That they were children and not always grown-up men and
women is clear from the above. This we may regard as
adoption pure and simple. Other cases are a legal method
of making provision for old age, or for other purposes for
which an heir as legal representative was desirable. In
the case of no legal heir, the property went back to the
next of kin.

Both parents of the adopted son were living. That the

The existing members of the family had a real interest
in the proceeding. For, as inheriting with them, the addition
of another son could not but affect their prospects. We
may wonder what influenced them to consent. That they
did consent is clear from the often-occurring covenant by
which they bound themselves not to object. One explanation
may be that they had grown up and left home and
were anxious for the welfare of their parents, but could not
arrange to look after them themselves. Hence for their
parents' sake they were willing to forego their share, or
submit to a stranger taking precedence of them, or in some
cases to give up all claim to the property in their parents'
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possession in return for being relieved of the responsibility
of looking after them. Of course, when the adopted son
was only taken in as one, even the eldest, among several, he
would only have a share at the parents' death. But it even
seems that the children might of their own motion adopt a
brother to be son to their parents.<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a>

The clause which implies disinheritance in case the parents
repudiate the son, or he repudiates them, could only
be enforced by a law-court.<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a>
But it was nevertheless most
regularly inserted in the contract. In one case the document
merely consists of it,<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> leaving us to infer that an
adopted son was concerned. But this is not absolutely certain.
The son might have been rebellious to his mother,
who was therefore minded to cut him off, and this may be
the result of her bringing her son before the judge. The
judge was bound to try and conciliate the parties.<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> Hence,
not infrequently the son was bound over not to repeat the
offence on pain of disinheritance, while the mother retained
her right to disinherit. There was no mention of his being
sold for a slave, or branded, as was usual when a son was
adopted and then repudiated his parents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to the contracts entered into by the parties,
parents could repudiate adopted sons. This was contrary
to the law by which the consent of the judge was needed
for disinheritance. It seems to be an attempt to contract
without the support of the law. The son was then to take
a son's share and go away.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a>

The adoption of a child by a lady of fortune was evidently
a good settlement for the child, and usually the real

the deed of adoption. He gave them two male and two
female slaves. Here also the girl covenanted to support
the adoptive mother.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a>

The division of property among the children invariably
followed the death of the father. We have a very large
number of contracts bearing on this custom. The contract
sets forth the particulars of the division and includes a
sworn declaration on the part of the recipients to make no
further claim. There were certain reservations to be made
in the case of minors, for whom a portion had to be set
aside to provide for their making the proper gifts to the
parents of their brides on marriage.

The Code deals at length with the laws of inheritance,
which are best treated under the head of marriage. The
actual examples occurring in the documents of the period
serve to illustrate the practical working of these laws, but
hardly add to our knowledge. They are usually occupied
with the division of property among brothers. Sometimes
we have some light on the reservations made in favor of
other members of the family. Thus two brothers divide
the property of their <span class="tei tei-q">âfather's houseâ</span> and of their sister,
a votary. The sister did not take her property, but the
brothers were trustees for her enjoyment of it during her
life, when it reverted to them in full.<a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a> The document
merely states the amount of one brother's share and the
other's agreement to be content with the division. In another
case, where four brothers share the property of their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">âfather's house,â</span> no details of their shares are given, but only
their agreement to abide by the division made.<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> In another
case the eldest brother allots to each of two younger
brothers a share and takes a woman slave and her children
as his portion. He is said to do this of his <span class="tei tei-q">âown power,â</span>
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ina emur á¸³amaniÅ¡u</span></span>, and to have given them this of his
<span class="tei tei-q">âown graciousness,â</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ina tÃ»bÃ¢tiÅ¡u</span></span>. The brothers
swear to make no further claim on the <span class="tei tei-q">âgrant,â</span>
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">marÅ¡Ã®tu</span></span>, of their father.
Either the property to which they were legally entitled had
already been allotted them, or possibly they had no legal
claim on any. The eldest brother is a high official, a
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pa-pa</span></span>, and perhaps had succeeded his father in office.
The father's property would then be the endowment of his
office, a grant from the king, and as such inalienable from
the office to which the eldest son had succeeded. The three
slaves may have thus been all the private property of the
father which was available for division. But the context
seems to suggest that what the brothers received was a concession
from the eldest brother on which they had no claim.
He may in consideration of his succeeding to his father's
appointment have made this concession to his brothers as a
consolation.<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a>
In another case a mother gives certain sums
to her three sons. She had still left two sons and two
daughters, and the first three agree to make no claim on
all that she and these four children have or shall acquire.<a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a> It is noteworthy that one of the three receives ten shekels
as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terá¸«atu</span></span> of the wife he shall marry. He was
evidently not of marriageable age, or, at any rate, still unmarried.
In such a case the Code directed that on partition of
the father's property, a special sum should be laid aside for
this necessary present to the bride's father.<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> So we find
two brothers giving a sister a share consisting of one-third
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> of a house, next her brother's, one maid, a bed and a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chair, with the promise that on the day that she marries and
enters her husband's house she shall receive further two-thirds
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GAN</span></span> of land and
slaves.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a>
The list of property is
often given, especially where brothers give shares to their
sisters. Sometimes the relationship is less close. Thus a
man shares with two sons of his father's brother, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, with
two cousins, ten <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> of unreclaimed land, taking three and
a half <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> as his
share.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a>
Sometimes the property included
the mother's marriage-portion. Thus three brothers divide
their property and two of them, as her sons, share their
mother's marriage-portion:<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see that each brother, if they were brothers,
obtained exactly the same share, one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> of land on which
a house was built. Two of them, Sin-ikisham and Ibni-Shamash,
were next door to each other. Ibni-Shamash had
the street on the other side of him, in fact, occupied a
corner house. The third brother, Urra-nÃ¢á¹£ir, had a house
in another part of the town. We therefore must understand
the word <span class="tei tei-q">âdividedâ</span> in the sense <span class="tei tei-q">âobtained on division.â</span>
In the second and third case the word rendered
share is literally <span class="tei tei-q">âall.â</span> But the first text shows that <span class="tei tei-q">âall
is completeâ</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">âthe share is complete.â</span> The meaning
of the expression, <span class="tei tei-q">âfrom mouth (?) to gold,â</span> is still obscure.
It is not certain that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bi-e</span></span> really means <span class="tei tei-q">âmouth.â</span>
But as Meissner has shown,<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> it exchanges with the ideogram
for <span class="tei tei-q">âmouth.â</span> He therefore suggests that the whole phrase
means <span class="tei tei-q">âfrom the first verbal discussion of the division to its
consummation by payment the partition of the property is
now at an end.â</span> That seems probable enough, but we may
yet find a different explanation. If this be correct, it is of
interest to note that while silver seems to have been the
usual money, this phrase seems to assume that gold would
be used in payment. A curious parallel is the fact that
while in later times we always find the order gold and
silver, in Sumerian texts it is silver and gold. We must
not press this too far, but it really looks as if in early
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
times silver was more valued, or at any rate, less in use
than gold.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be noted that the second text omits Marduk from
the oath, while the others name him. The third text omits
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gamru</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âis complete.â</span>
The nine witnesses and the date
are the same for all three. In the first and last the names
of the witnesses only are given, but in the second the name
of the father is added to several of them.

documents</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the case of testamentary documents, using the phrase
in a loose way to cover gifts embodied in a deed, we usually
find a list of property donated. These lists give rise to
insuperable difficulties to the translator. The difficulties
are not so much due to the imperfections of our knowledge
of Babylonian methods of writing as to the practical impossibility
of finding exact terms in one language for the
terms relating to domestic furniture in another. Even in
the case of languages so well known to us as French and
German are, we are obliged to transfer their words unaltered
into our own tongue. The most skilled translator must
leave a French or German <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">menu</span></em> untranslated. We know
for instance that the signs, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GIÅ -GU-ZA</span></span> were used to denote
the Babylonian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kussÃ»</span></span>. When a god or king sat upon a
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kussÃ»</span></span> we may be satisfied with the rendering
<span class="tei tei-q">âthrone,â</span> but when we find a lady leaving her daughter six
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kussÃª</span></span>
we feel that <span class="tei tei-q">âthroneâ</span> is rather too grand. But whether
we elect to call them chairs, stools, or seats, we are guilty
of some false suggestion. A careful examination of the
sculptured and pictured monuments may give us a clearer
idea of what seats were used. The reader may consult
Perrot and Chipiez, or the dictionaries of the Bible, under
the articles: chairs, couches, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et cetera</span></span>, for illustrations.
Unless we can find a picture with a named article upon it
we are still left a wide margin of conjecture. The picture
of Sennacherib receiving the tribute and submission of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lachish gives the contemporary representation of a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kussÃ»
nimedu</span></span>, but we cannot argue that every
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kussÃ»</span></span> was of the
same pattern.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may decline to attempt a solution and merely give
the original word, we may make a purely arbitrary rendering,
or we may accompany the original word with an approximate
indication of what is known of its nature. In neither
case do we translate, for that is clearly impossible. But
the reader needs a word of caution against the translations
which show no signs of hesitancy. They are not indicative
of greater knowledge, but of less candor. Further, to
scholars a reminder is needed that even the syllabaries and
bilingual texts do not give exact information. Thus alongside
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GIÅ -GU-ZA</span></span> we find a number of other ideograms, all
of which are in certain connections rendered <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kussÃ»</span></span>,
adequately enough no doubt, but that they all denoted exactly
the same article of furniture is far from likely. A closer
approximation to an exact rendering may come with the
knowledge of a large number of different contexts, each of
which may shade off something of the rough meaning. One
of the great difficulties of the translator is that the same
word often occurs again and again, but always in exactly
the same context. This is especially the case in the legal
documents, filled as they are with stock phrases.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
legal form. The father must say to a judge, <span class="tei tei-q">âI renounce
my son.â</span> The judge must then inquire into the grounds of
this determination. A grave fault must be alleged. What
this was we are not told. But rebellious conduct, idleness,
and failure to provide for parents are probable. A parent
had the right to his son's work. An adoptive parent had a
right by the deed of adoption to maintenance. If the fault
could be established as a first offence, the judge was bound
to try and reconcile the father. If it was repeated, disinheritance
took place legally. It was done by a deed duly
drawn up. The Sumerian laws show that a mother had
the same power as the father. Whether this was only
exercised when there was no father, or whether a wife
could act in this way independently of her husband in disinheriting
children, does not appear. But possibly she
had power in this respect only over her own property.<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a>

In modern thought slavery concerns personal rights.
But it was not thus regarded by the Babylonians, for the
slave was an inferior domestic, and, like the son in his
father's house, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">minor capitis</span></span>.
That he was actually a chattel
is clear from his being sold, pledged, or deposited. He
was property and as such a money equivalent. He might
be made use of to discharge a debt, according to his value.
Hence, while some account of slavery belongs with the discussion
of the family, it is also a part of the section dealing
with property, since the slave was a piece of property.

But the slave had a great amount of freedom, and was
in no respect worse off than a child or even a wife. He
could acquire property, marry a free woman, engage in
trade, and act as principal in contract with a free man.
Only, his property, at his death, fell to his master. He was
bound to do service without pay, though he had the right
to food and drink. He could not leave his master's service
at his own will, but he might acquire enough property to
buy his freedom. He was tied to one spot, not being
allowed to leave the city, but might be sent anywhere at
command.

His status was, however, a complex of seeming inconsistencies.

Oppert in his tract, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Condition des Esclaves Ã  Babylone,

Dr. Peiser discussed the question thoroughly in their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aus

We shall come back to it later under the head of Sales of

By far the greatest number of references to the slave
condition occur in documents relating to the sale of slaves.
These may be summarized here. One peculiarity always
marked the sale of a slave, it was not so irrevocable as that
of a house or field. For a slave might not be all he seemed.
He might be diseased, or subject to fits, he might have vices
of disposition, especially a tendency to run away. A female
slave might be defective in what constituted her chief
attraction. Hence there was usually a stipulation that if
the buyer had a legitimate cause of complaint he could
return his purchase and have his money back. In fact, an
undisclosed defect would invalidate the sale. These defects
might be physical, inherent, contingent, or legal.

of the contract to buy a slave</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There seems to have been a dreaded disease called the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bennu</span></span>. Professor Jensen<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a> has shown how largely it bulks
in the literature, and what dire effects are ascribed to it.
But it was not the only severe disease from which men
suffered then. It is associated with several others as bad.
Hence in legal documents we may take it as a typical example
of a serious disease, which would so detract from the
value of a slave that the purchaser would not keep him. It
is evident that it was something that the purchaser could
not detect at sight. Perhaps it was a disease which took
some time to show itself. It is mentioned in the Code and
in the sales of slaves of the First Dynasty of Babylon. It
also occurs in Assyrian deeds of sale, down to the end of
the seventh century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The Code and the contemporary
contracts allow one month within which a plea could be
raised that the slave had the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bennu</span></span>. The purchaser could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

mythological texts as equally dreaded. It affected the hands or the
mouth. We may render it <span class="tei tei-q">âseizure,â</span> and think of some

The objections which come under the head of legal defects

<span class="tei tei-q">âcomplaint.â</span> In the contracts and Code this could be pleaded

<span class="tei tei-q">âa vice,â</span> could be the ground for repudiation at any time. This might
arise from the disposition of the slave. The sale might
also be invalidated by a claim on him for service to the
state; by a lien held by a creditor; by a claim to free
citizenship. But we are not yet in a position to state definitely
what was the exact nature of these claims. Doubtless
the recovery of further codes will fix them finally.

In Assyrian times sales of slaves are very frequent, and we
learn much more about the status of the slave. The slave
was certainly a social inferior, but probably had more freedom
than any other who ever bore the name. He certainly
had his own property and could contract like a free man.
A young slave lived in his master's house up to a certain
age, when his master found a wife for him. This was usually
a slave-girl. The female slaves remained in the house
as domestic servants to old age, unless they were married to
a slave. Married slaves lived in their own houses for the
most part. Many such men seem to have taken up out-door
work, gardening, agricultural labor, or the like, on their
master's estates. Others engaged in business on their own
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account. But from all the master had a certain income.
This was, within a little, the average interest on the money-value
of a slave. And that interest was usually twenty-five
per cent. per annum in Assyria.

and family</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theoretically a master owned his slave's property. What
this ownership amounted to is hard to say. But the slave
was rarely separated from it. His family at any rate was
sacred. When sold, he was sold with his family. This, of
course, does not exclude the sale of a young man at a time
when he would naturally leave his father's home. Young
women were taken into domestic service, and after a time
sold. But there was none of that tearing of children from
parents, which so shocked people in the modern examples.
It is probable that a slave could not marry without his master's
consent. He certainly could not live where he liked.
But he was free to acquire fair wealth, and his property was
so far his own that he could buy his own freedom with it.

In Assyria there was a large body of serfs, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">glebae
adscripti</span></span>. They could be sold with the land. But they were free to
work as they chose. Usually they cultivated a plot of their
master's, but often had lands and stock of their own. They
were not free to move, and probably paid a rent, one or two
thirds of their produce. But they were mostly on the metayer
system, and could claim seed, implements, stock, and
other necessary supplies from their master. This class evidently
possessed privileges highly esteemed, for their ranks
were recruited from all classes of artisans in the towns,
cooks, brewers, gardeners, washermen, and even scribes.
Some of these were probably free men, others certainly
had been slaves.

The three classes, domestic slaves, married slaves, and
serfs, were continually exchanging their condition. Not a
few free men, whether from debt, judicial sentence, or choice,
were added to these classes. For these men, if dependent,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were cared for and provided with the necessaries of life.
They were, if domestic, clothed, housed, and fed; if they
married and lived out, they were given a house, and either
were provided with land that brought them a living, or
engaged in business.

The army and corvÃ©e, or levy for forced labor, were chiefly
obtained from the slaves, and above all from the serfs. A
head of a family, or mother, was not liable. But young
men and women had to serve a certain number of terms of
service, seemingly six.<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a>

buyer of a slave to receive a guarantee that this claim had
been satisfied.

We have many examples of slaves who were skilled artisans.
They had been taught a handicraft. Later we shall

But all the artisans were not slaves. Indeed, some of the
craftsmen, as goldsmiths, silversmiths, carpenters, were
wealthy persons.

As a rule, though the slave is named, his father is not.
But, just as in mediÃ¦val times, a serf's father is named.
The serf's holding seems to have been hereditary. But we
have too few examples to be sure of our ground here. The
slave's father was not concerned in the sale, and that may
be the sole reason why he is not named. Fathers sometimes
sold their children to be slaves, then they are named. Such
sales are not so unnatural as they appear. It was a sure provision
for life for a child to sell him as slave to a family in
good position.

That a slave would escape by flight was always a danger.
The slave had great freedom and many opportunities of getting
away. The only security was that wherever he went
he was likely to be recognized as a slave and anyone might
recapture him. However, the captor had a right to a reward
and so the owner would have to pay to get him back,
besides losing his services for a time. Hence a slave who
had a fancy for running away was likely to be troublesome
and costly. That might lead to his being sold. But the
purchaser protected himself by a guarantee on the seller's
part that the slave would not run away. Then if the slave
fled and was brought back, the captor gave a receipt for the
sum paid him, and the owner reclaimed it from the seller.

other cases the seller had to recover the slave for the
buyer. In Assyrian times the seller guaranteed also
against death. Here it has been argued that the guarantee
meant only that the slave had not fled or was not dead at
the time of sale. This is not likely in the case of death.
Surely no man could buy a slave who was dead. He
would not pay, if the slave was not delivered. But he
might bargain for recompense, if the slave died within a
short time after purchase, as the seller might have had
reason to know that he was ill.

There is frequent mention in early times of a mark upon
slaves. The Code<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> talks of marking a slave, but in a way
that is difficult to understand. The verb usually rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">âbrandâ</span> has been shown by Professor P.
Jensen<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> to include
incised marks. Hence the penalty which was once rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">âshear his front hairâ</span> is thought to mean <span class="tei tei-q">âbrand his forehead.â</span>
The Code fixes a severe penalty for the putting of
an indelible mark on a slave without his owner's consent.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This could hardly be enforced for merely giving the slave a
bald forehead, like the Hebrew <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">peÃ´t</span></span>,
or like a <span class="tei tei-q">âtonsure.â</span> The mark borne on the forehead by Cain, or by the <span class="tei tei-q">âsealedâ</span>
in the Apocalypse, is far more to the point as a parallel.
The slaves also wore little clay tablets with the name of
their owner inscribed upon them. There are a number of
these preserved in the Louvre. On one now in the British
Museum we have this inscription: <span class="tei tei-q">âOf the woman á¸¤ipÃ¢,
who is in the hands of Sin-Ãªresh. Sebat, eleventh year of
Merodach-baladan, King of Babylon.â</span><a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> How these were
attached to the slave is not very clear. But they must have
been anything but an indelible mark. In the later Babylonian
times we have<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>
a slave marked by a sign on his ears
and a white mark in his eye. Both may denote natural
marks.<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> A more definite example is a slave <span class="tei tei-q">âwhose right
hand has written upon it the name of Ina-Esagil-lilburâ</span>;<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a>
and another <span class="tei tei-q">âon whose left hand was written the name
of Meskitu.â</span><a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> These were the names of the owners, not of
the slaves themselves. This renders it probable that the
branding and the like was always an incised mark, a species
of tattoo, which of course was indelible. That the same person
who tattooed men should brand animals, or even shear
them, is not an insuperable objection. But there is no
reason to suppose that the brander ever was a sheep-shearer.

In respect to the names of slaves we may regard them
with some interest as helping to determine the sources from
which slaves were recruited. Some bear good Babylonian
names, and perhaps when the father's name is also Babylonian
we may conclude that they had been born free, but were
either sold into slavery by the head of the family, or, having
once been adopted, had been repudiated and reduced to
slavery again, or had been sold for debt. We have examples
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of all such cases. A father and mother sold their son;<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a>

When the slave's name is not Babylonian or Assyrian, a
foreign nationality is nearly certain. These names are very
valuable when they can be assigned to their nationalities,
as confirming the historical claims of the kings to conquest.
Sometimes they are actual gentile names, as Miá¹£irai,
<span class="tei tei-q">âEgyptian,â</span> Tubalai, <span class="tei tei-q">âman from Tubal.â</span> But many may
have been directly purchased abroad and sold to Babylonians.
A great many foreign slaves doubtless received
native names. Thus an Egyptian woman was called NanÃ¢-ittÃ®a.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> Some of the names of slaves are true Babylonian,
but of a rare and odd form, which has caused some to
imagine them to be foreign. But this is not necessary.
Servants are often renamed after the families to which they
belong, and finally become known by names which were
never theirs. Masters seem sometimes to have given their
own names to slaves. Their names are often contracted,<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a>

The slaves were not only captives taken in war, but were
bought abroad, and not a few were reduced to that condition
from being freeborn citizens. Slavery awaited the rebellious
child or the contentious wife. But it was not allowed
by the Code for a man to sell his maid outright, who
had borne him children. And if he sold his wife or child to
pay a debt, the buyer could not keep them beyond a certain
time. But in all periods parents sold their children, and
there does not seem to be any clause demanding any future
release.

The slave had private property which was secured to
him. He paid a sort of rent for it. This was an annual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fixed sum called his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mandattu</span></span>, the same word as for the
tribute of a prince to his overlord. In the case of a female
slave this was twelve shekels <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per annum</span></span>. Further, he paid
a percentage on his profits.<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a> The slave might hold another
slave as pledge, lend money, and enter into business relations
with another slave even of the same house. He might borrow
money of another slave. Hence he was very free to do
business. But when he entered into business relations with
another master's slave, or a free man, he sometimes met
with a difficulty. He seemingly could not enforce his own
rights against a free man. At any rate, we find that in such
cases his master assumed the liability and pleaded for him.
In fact, the master had to acknowledge his undertakings,
though he did not guarantee them. Subject to this protection
from his master, the slave was free to engage in commerce.
He lent to free men, entered into partnership, and
owned a scribe.

S had taken a loan of L. His master, A, became aware of
it and guaranteed its repayment. He then put S into L's
hands as his pledge to pay it off. Now, A died, and his
son, B, sells S to C, as part of his own property. But L
still holds possession of S. C demands S from L. L says
<span class="tei tei-q">âNot until my money is paid off. If C will do this he
may have S. But until he can prove that it has been done
he cannot have S.â</span> The proof probably lay in B's hands, if
he had preserved it from his father A's records. Delay is
granted for C to produce the proof that S has worked off
the debt. It is clear that the evidence of S was not admitted
on this point.

That in the case of some slaves their value to their master
consisted in their <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mandattu</span></span> is clear from the fact when a
master sold a slave and did not at once hand him over, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Of course, in transferring a slave to another owner,
the seller could not separate him from his property. That
was his own. A slave who had acquired a fair amount of
wealth, or was earning well in trade, would produce a higher
income to his master and sell for more. What was sold
then, was an interest, the master's, in his slave's work.
Hence prices varied very much. We are not always able
to see what was the reason of the high price, but it was
evident then to those who made the bargain. An average
price in the later Babylonian era seems to have been twenty
shekels, the interest on which at the usual twenty per cent.
would be four shekels. This, then, was the annual value of
a slave above his keep. If the keep amounted to about
eight shekels <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per annum</span></span>, that gives the value of a
slave's work as twelve shekels yearly. This is what an unskilled
slave was worth to his master. If, then, a man married
a slave-girl, he ought to pay her master about twelve
shekels a year for his loss of her services. Of course, the
master retained his right over her, but it seems to have been
a tacit understanding that he could not sell her away from
her husband. So really what he sold was, after all, only a
right to income from her husband of twelve shekels a year.
The children were also his born slaves, if the father was his
slave. We do not know how matters would be arranged
if the man was slave to one master, the wife to another.
Probably this was provided against by the master giving his
slave a wife from his own maids, or buying a slave-girl as
wife for him.

It occasionally happens that we can trace the history
of a particular slave for some time. Thus, Bariki-ilu was
pledged for twenty-eight shekels to Aá¸«inÃ»ri, in the thirty-fifth
year of Nebuchadrezzar.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a> In the next year we find

him in the possession of Piru, his wife GagÃ¢, and a cousin
ZirÃ®a. What they gave for him does not appear. But they
now sold him for twenty-three shekels to NabÃ»-zÃªr-ukÃ®n.
He must have fled from his new master, for four years later,
the same three people pledged him.<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> But he seems to have
been unsatisfactory as a pledge. For next, we find that
GagÃ¢'s daughter (Piru having probably died), being about
to be married to Iddin-aplu, this slave was set down as
part of her marriage-portion. She gave him over to her
husband and his son. In their possession he remained
awhile, but on the death of his mistress, was handed over to
the great banker, Itti-Marduk-balÃ¢á¹­u. These events, extending
from the thirty-fifth year of Nebuchadrezzar to the
seventh year of Nabonidus, were all put in evidence when
Bariki-ilu tried later to prove that he was a free man. He
pretended to be the adopted son of BÃªl-rimÃ¢ni. He had to
confess that he had twice run away from his master and had
been many days in hiding. Then he was afraid and pretended
to have been an adopted son. This, if proved, would
have freed him. But he confessed that it was a pretence,
and had to return to his servitude. The case was decided
in the tenth year of Nabonidus.

One feature which the later Babylonian contracts show
us for the first time, but which probably was always in
force, is the apprenticing of slaves to a trade. Instances of
this are fairly numerous. The person to whom the slave
was apprenticed was usually a slave himself. The teacher
was bound to teach the trade thoroughly. The owner of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
slave gave him up to the teacher for a fixed term of years,
differing for different trades. He had to furnish a daily
allowance of food and a regular supply of clothing. At the
end of the term, the slave might remain with his teacher on
payment of a fixed <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mandattu</span></span>
or income to the owner. Penalties
were fixed for neglecting to teach him properly.

A question of considerable interest which needs to be
worked out is the relative number of slaves in the population.
In early times the impression one gets is that they
were few. Even in the time of the First Dynasty of Babylon,
the evidence at the disposal of Dr. Meissner in 1892 did
not allow him to exceed four as the number in the possession
of one man at a time. But since then further evidence
is available. Thus we read of twelve slaves at once, seven
males and five females, given by a father to his daughter,
at Sippara.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> In Assyrian times the number in an average

as thirty mentioned at one time.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a> So in later times there
are generally only one or two in a household, but the number

The amount of land might be increased by purchase, but

In looking back upon the primitive state of the country,
its natural features must be taken into account as helping
to shape the course of development. In such a low-lying
country as the land between the Euphrates and the Tigris,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
floods naturally occur every year. Every spot of land that
stood above the level of the annual floods was thereby
marked out for a residence. Throughout the literature of
Babylonia the hill or the mountain is a refuge and a place
protected by the gods. But when the floods were gone,
man's great need for his land was water. Hence irrigation
was synonymous with cultivation. The unclaimed land
grew rank with grass and natural food for cattle, but dried
up to dust in the summer. Hence the control of the flood,
its diversion into desired channels, regulation, storage, and
all the processes implied by canals and irrigation were
forced upon the inhabitants of Babylonia by stern necessity.
The only alternative was to migrate with flocks and herds
to higher lands when the floods came.

Settled society was ultimately founded upon the cultivation
of a plain. Every eminence might become a hamlet
occupied by the abodes of men, whose fields were
water meadows. The meadows which grew their corn lay
around the village and below its level; and beyond those
which were needed to grow crops lay the pastures. But
for security the cattle and sheep must come back, before
the floods came, to the village, there to be folded and fed, as
it seems, upon straw and also grain. The land of the village
extended itself in time, as the population grew and needed
more corn. More and more of the unreclaimed land beyond
the cornfields was brought into cultivation and the flocks
went farther afield for pasture. This continued until the
pastures forming the outlying ring had met the pastures of
another village.

Such is an ideal sketch of the growth of land tenure.
But in historical times this simplicity had vanished. Land
was owned, not merely held. It does not appear that pasture
was owned, even as late as the First Dynasty of Babylon.
It seems that the flocks were confided to shepherds,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who were bound to bring them back from the pastures and
expected to account for all they took out and for a reasonable
increase in the flock from breeding. The pasture was
common land; at any rate, to the sheep-owners of the same
village. No one claims to buy and sell pasture land, only
cultivated land, fields, gardens, and plantations, ultimately
irrigated land. But unreclaimed land, that is, such as only
required cultivation to make it fields and gardens, is often
sold, or let, to be reclaimed. Was this a trespass on the
pasture held in common? If so, it was not resented as
such. We do not know yet how a man acquired a title to
such unreclaimed land. Perhaps to have brought it into
cultivation sufficed originally to establish title.

A settled hamlet soon had its temple. Some think that
the god was ideally landlord of all the village land and
that every title represented simply the rental of the land
from the nominal owner. We do indeed find the temples
as owners of vast estates and, like monastic institutions in
the Middle Ages, letting lands and houses. To the temples
poor men went for temporary accommodation for sowing,
for wages at harvest-time, and for ransom from the enemy.
These they had a right by custom to receive without paying
interest. Undoubtedly the temples became the first
centres of progressive civilization. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">patÃªsi</span></span>,
as chief-priest of the god, was the regent of the community. In
process of time, as villages combined and grew into towns
and districts, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">patÃªsi</span></span>,
in virtue of his town's supremacy,
became the king, who, as regent of the state and representative
of the gods, owned all. We know that, in later times,
the king in Babylon was the adoptive son of Bel-Merodach.<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a>

In historical times no such conditions prevail. Doubtless
the tribal ownership had become theoretically transferred
to the god, or to the town. That the town had a

theoretical personality of its own is clear enough from the
oaths sworn to confirm a sale. Men swore by the gods, the
king, and also by Sippara, or Kar Sippara. But there is no
indication that points to the god, or the town, or the king
as having any power to intervene to prevent a sale, or to
claim payment for consent. It is clear that the land was
sold subject to its dues, and they were many. But the
private ownership, subject to such reservation, was absolute.
The one danger to a purchaser was that the family of
the seller should claim a right of redemption and annul the
sale. Against this the seller undertook to indemnify him.

From the point of view of the ancient Babylonian, as
from that of the modern lawyer, there was a great similarity
about all classes of real property. The deeds of sale or
conveyances, as well as the leases, treated them with much
the same formula. It was the land which was the main
consideration. It was as land, built upon indeed, but
essentially as land, that the house was sold. The house is
rarely described by what to modern views would be its
most important features, the number of stories, rooms, conveniences,
and the like. Instead its area was stated. This
is remarkable, as we do not buy houses by the area. We
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
need not suppose that the building actually covered all the
land sold. In fact, we often see that it had a garden.
But it was <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu epÅ¡u</span></span>,
a <span class="tei tei-q">âbuilt-on plotâ</span> of land, according
to the Babylonian conveyancer. Perhaps there was in this
usage a recollection of how fast the Babylonian house of
sun-dried brick sank down to a mound of clay, perhaps,
too, a far-off echo of the nomad's scorn for the town-dweller,
in both cases a recognition that the land was the one thing
permanent, the one thing that could not <span class="tei tei-q">ârun away.â</span>

of a house upon it, it was <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu epÅ¡u</span></span>,
a <span class="tei tei-q">âbuilt-on plot.â</span> Gradually the edifice, in towns at least, absorbed the whole
significance, and in common parlance <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span>
meant a <span class="tei tei-q">âhouse,â</span> but in legal phraseology it always retained its inclusive
meaning of the plot of land. Even as late as the Assyrian
Empire it retained some shade of a still earlier meaning,
that of a plot, parcel, or share, just what it meant when the
first settlers divided the land among them. Thus one
might use <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span> of a
<span class="tei tei-q">âlotâ</span> of slaves, or of a lot of land including
its slaves and cattle. That <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span> is to be referred to
a root <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">banÃ»</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âto make,â</span>
may still be true, though <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">banÃ»</span></span>
cannot have come to mean <span class="tei tei-q">âbuildâ</span> when <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span> was
formed from it. If <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span>
was originally the <span class="tei tei-q">âhouse,â</span> perhaps only
a tent-house, then it could mean all that constituted the
house, the man's house in a wider sense, as in tribe names,
like BÃ®t Adini or the phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">âHouse of Israel.â</span> But
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span>, when used of a house,
does not carry with it the implication
of bricks and mortar, only of a fixed site occupied for
dwelling. The edifice was implied by the addition <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">epÅ¡u</span></span>,
marking the site <span class="tei tei-q">âbuilt upon.â</span> So a house was <span class="tei tei-q">âlanded
propertyâ</span>; land was of various sorts, one of which is
<span class="tei tei-q">âbuilt on land.â</span> To be accurate one must also specify the
kind of building.

does not denote open waste land, but a cultivated plot.
Indeed, it is probable that its Sumerian name implies <span class="tei tei-q">âirrigation.â</span>
In any case it was fenced, if only by a raised
ridge; it was cultivated and watched over; the birds were
scared away, robbers and stray animals driven off. So
much at least is expressed in as many words in the undertakings
of tenants to treat a field properly. The field was
also <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span> as land, usually
<span class="tei tei-q">â<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span>, so much

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kirÃ»</span></span>
was not exact enough. It was usual to designate further
of what sort it was, whether vegetable garden, orchard,
or palm-grove. The scribe would even add <span class="tei tei-q">âplanted with
such and such a crop.â</span> The term might include vineyards.
In many cases the actual number of bushes, or fruit-trees, or

land, and as such <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span>, with the qualifications

For land measures there were two systems in use, one
purely areal, the other with a reference to the average yield.
In the former case the scale of measures was discovered
and formulated by Dr. G. Reisner, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sitzungsberichte

In this scale <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">1 GAN = 1,800 SAR</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">1 SAR = 60 GIN</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">1 GIN =

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GIN</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Å E</span></span>
were read; they may be ideograms or Sumerian words.
There was also a very large measure of area, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">3,600
GAN</span></span>, perhaps called a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">karu</span></span>. Mr. Thureau-Dangin has
further shown that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> was the square of the measure
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GAR-DU</span></span>, which seems at one time to have measured
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">12 U</span></span>.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">U</span></span> is often taken to be a cubit, but seems at this time
to have been nine hundred and ninety millimetres, which is
sometimes called <span class="tei tei-q">âa double cubit.â</span> On these suppositions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> would be a square, each side measuring about
twenty-two yards, about one-tenth of an acre, or four ares
on the metrical system. But it is certain that both in early
times and during the First Dynasty of Babylon the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GAR</span></span>
was only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">12 U</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">U</span></span>,
if a cubit, would not be much over eighteen inches.
This would make the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> a square
of about eighteen feet on each side. The fact that a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span>
was a fairly common size for a house seems rather against
the smaller area. What is yet wanted is some cuneiform
statement of the size or area of something which can be
exactly identified and measured. With further exploration
this is almost sure to be found.<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span> of land,
where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">1 GUR = 300 á¸²A</span></span>, as shown

so called because it took a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn to sow it, or because
it yielded a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn as an average harvest.
These are mere guesses and we must remain in ignorance

But the plots became gradually of all sizes and shapes,
as the many plans of estates show. The lengths of the
sides are usually given on such plans, and much labor has
been expended with small result on reconciling the given
dimensions with the area ascribed to the plot. But it is certain
that these were often recorded merely for purposes of
identification. The area of the field was well known, and its
average crop also, without any need of resort to calculations.

These plots often bear their owner's name, and that long
after he had passed away. The boundary-stones of the field
were sacred. Not a few were inscribed with some sort of
history of the plot. Especially was this the case when the
land was granted to fresh owners, by sale, or charter. No
inconsiderable portion of what we know of history is derived
from inscribed boundary-stones. They are the oldest
monuments and rarely deeply buried. Hence they are easy
to find. They have even been brought to London, as ship's
ballast, in times before they could be read. They would be
invaluable, if found <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in situ</span></span>, for a modern survey of the
country and a reconstruction of its ancient history. As a

In ancient days great importance was attached to their
preservation. The kings taxed their powers of cursing in
order to terrify men from removing their neighbor's landmark.
The dangers to the stone contemplated were its removal
to another place, its being thrown into the water, or
into the fire, its being built into a wall,<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a>

Akin to the crime of encroaching upon old landmarks was that of
building upon or otherwise encroaching on the highway.
To do this might subject the builder to the danger of being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

That the land was sold subject to certain territorial obligations,
we can glean from many hints. One of the most
important is that, when a favorite, or well-deserving official,
had acquired a large estate, the king by charter granted him
an immunity from these obligations. These charters were
often inscribed on large blocks of stone or water-worn pebbles
of great size, and seem to have been set up as boundary-stones.
Some were reproduced from tablets written
on clay.<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a>
They are very numerous and in some periods of
the history are the only monuments that have reached us.
A glance through any history of Babylonia will show the
reader how much depends on them. But here our only
concern is with the light they throw on land tenure and its
conditions. One of the points which at once becomes clear
is that, although the king was representative of the god and
titular head of all the tribes, he could not appropriate land
just where he chose. Manistusu, King of Kish, when he
was seeking to acquire a fine estate to present to his son,
Mesilim, had to buy land at what seems to have been an
average price. He paid for the land in corn at three and
one-third <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn per <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GAN</span></span>,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> being worth one
shekel of silver. This was the price. But, as was usual
later in private purchases, a present to the former owner
was given. The list of these presents is most interesting,âsilver
and copper vessels and rich vestments being the chief
items. Of great importance is the reference to the leading
men of each hamlet as sellers. The king's own land was a
definite area, so definite as to be cited as a boundary.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a>

tablet which records how Sargon, in the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 713, having
taken possession of some lands in Maganuba to form
part of his new city of DÃ»r-Sargon, found that he was displacing
an old endowment given by Adadi-nirÃ¢ri to the god
Ashur. It was held by a family descended from the original
recipients. Sargon increased their holding and charged
it with an increased monthly offering to the
temple.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> He
gave <span class="tei tei-q">âfield for field,â</span> but also added largely to the endowments.
He acted much the same in Babylonia, where the
Suti had encroached upon the lands of the people. He
drove out the invaders, restored the lands, but laid them
under obligations, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kidinÃ»tu</span></span>, making them render a monthly

On the other hand, we find that the kings granted large
grants of land to temples and private persons. From what
source these grants were made does not appear. Probably
from his own personal property. The property so presented
was free of imposts. But we may not assume that the king
was always the poorer. The beneficiary may have bought
the land and presented it to the king, to be received back

vassal had been governor of a district on the borders of
Elam, but the privileges of his country had been much curtailed

restored and apparently augmented. They were, that the
King of Namar had no right of entry, could not levy taxes

The usual method of hiring land was on shares. The
Code contemplates that this would be for a proportion fixed
by contract, either one-half or one-third of the produce
going to the owner, in the case of a field or irrigated
meadow and two-thirds in the case of a garden.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> The difference was due to the fact that in the former case the
owner furnished the land only, possibly with its water-supply;
in the latter case he also furnished the plants. In
the contemporary contracts we have but few cases where
the crop is shared. In these cases the owner and tenant
share equally.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a>
The tenant was also to erect a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">manaá¸«tu</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-q">âdwelling.â</span> It was needful that he should reside on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
property to take care of the crop. This was stipulated
for and the clause added that he should hand over the
dwelling to the landlord. For such dwellings compare
the <span class="tei tei-q">âcottage in the wildernessâ</span> of Isaiah 1. 8.

Fields were also let at a fixed rent, usually payable in
kind. The contracts of the First Dynasty of Babylon give
a large number of examples of this sort. The kinds of
field are distinguished as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">AB-SIN</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡erÃ»</span></span>,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">KI-DAN</span></span>.
The average rent for the former was eight <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn per
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GAN</span></span>; of the latter, eighteen
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> per <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GAN</span></span>. The former
class may include land with corn standing upon it, or
simply corn-land; the latter land as yet unbroken, or
fallow. The latter class seems to have been much more
fertile.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This rent later became more fixed because the average
yield per area was set down in the lease and the yield in
corn was estimated in money according to the ordinary
value of corn. Thus the rent is stated to be so much
money.

Land was often let to reclaim, or plant. The Code lays
down as law what was evidently a common practice. In
the case of waste land given to be reclaimed the tenant was
rent free for three whole years. In the fourth year he paid
a fixed rent in corn, ten <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> per

Freedom from various obligations might be granted by
royal charter. In fact, it is from these charters that we
know of the existence of the obligations for the most part.
The land so freed was called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">zakÃ»</span></span>. Land sold is often
said to be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">zakÃ»</span></span>, and we may suppose it was so because
it had once been freed by charter. But this is not quite certain.
The charter was granted to a person and his heirs. Doubtless,
as long as they held it, it would be free, but it is not
clear that they could sell it as freed forever. But we only
know that some land was free. On whom then fell the
obligations? So far as they were due to the king, they
may have been abolished, but such obligations as repairs of
the canal banks must surely have been taken up by others.
If not, the granting of charters must have been a fruitful
source of trouble and distress to the land.

The obligations were of various kinds. Some were directly
extensions of the duty of a tenant to exercise proper
care of the estate. A very prominent duty was the care of
the canals. To see that they were kept in proper order
was the mark of good government. To allow them to fall
into disrepair was probably the result of weak government,
or the exhaustion due to defeat in war. But it very soon
led to the impoverishment of the country. The Code contemplates
the care of the canal banks, or dikes, as the duty
of the land-owner adjoining.<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a> It holds him responsible for
any damage done to the neighbors' crops by his neglect to
close a breach, or leaving the feed-pipe running beyond the
time needed to water his field. But the canal was also
liable to silt up or become choked with water-weeds, and
the care of dredging it out was that of the district governor.
He might carry out this duty by summoning the riparian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

There was always a militia, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Landwehr</span></span>, or territorial levy

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ummanÃ¢te</span></span>. We have no direct statements

free. The daughters as well as sons were subject to service,
probably to repair to the great weaving houses in the

own house. His children were born to slavery, but were
usually not separated in early life from their parents.
They entered their master's service, and might be sold when

paying a fixed sum to their master. They might become
agricultural laborers, and so attain a fixity of tenure as

long list of powers which could be exercised by the king's officials over
land. They are levies or forced contributions of wood,
crops, straw, corn, wagons, harness, asses or men, rights to
abstract water from canals, to drink from the water, to
pasture herbage, or set on the royal flocks or herds, to pasture
sheep, to construct roads or bridges. These are referred

property. All we can conclude is that the king had a right
to impress such things or such labor. Few, if any, other
documents are so full and explicit as to the dues exacted
from the land, but all these dues are mentioned again, one
or two together, in almost all the charters.

The evidence for the existence of tithe in the later Babylonian
period is very full. All seem to have paid it, from the
king downward. Nabonidus paid, on his accession, to the
temple at Sippara, five minas of gold. It was a very large
sum, but may have been a sort of succession duty rather
than an income-tax.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a> It is curious that we also find

This shows that the Persians were friendly invaders and
respected the rights of private property and of the temples.
Belshazzar also paid tithe, through his major-domo, to BÃªl,
NabÃ», NÃªrgal, and BÃªlit of Erech.<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>

Tithe was usually paid in kind, on all natural products,

The temple exerted an overwhelming financial influence
in smaller towns. Only in certain large cities was it rivalled
by a few great firms. Its financial status was that of the
chief, if not the only, great capitalist. Its political influence
was also great. This was largely enlisted on the side of

The importance of the temple was partially the result of
the large dues paid to it. These consisted primarily of a
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ginÃ»</span></span>, or fixed
customary daily payment, and a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sattukku</span></span>, or
fixed monthly payment. How these arose is still obscure.
They were paid in all sorts of natural products, paid in kind,
measured by the temple surveyor on the field. Doubtless,
these were due from temple lands, and grew out of the endowments
given to the temple. These often consisted of
land, held in perpetuity by a family, charged with a payment
to the temple. The land could not be let or sold by the
temple, nor by the family. Such land was usually freed
from all other state dues. The endowment was thus at the
expense of the state. An enormous number of the tablets
which have reached us from the later Babylonian times
concern the payment of these dues. They mostly consisted
of corn and sesame, or other offerings, and the tablets are
receipts for them. In Assyrian times the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ginÃ»</span></span> also included
flesh of animals and birds. In some few cases we
have long lists of these daily dues, accompanied by precious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gifts in addition. The gifts were perishable, but were accompanied
by a note specifying them, and the good wishes
or purpose of the donor.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a> These notes were preserved as
mementos of the donor's good-will.

Temples, however, also possessed lands which they could
let. They also held houses which they might
let.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> In fact,
the temples could hold any sort of property, but apparently
could not alienate any. Some lands the temple officials administered
themselves, having their own work-people. We
have mention of these lands from the earliest times (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, the
very early tablet referred to above),<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> right down through the
Sumerian period. We have almost endless temple accounts,
many of which relate to the fields of the temple, giving their
dimensions and situation, with the names of the tenants, or
serfs, and the rents or crops expected of them. Then, in
the First Dynasty of Babylon, we find the lands, gardens,
courts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et cetera</span></span>, of the gods named. We no longer have
the temple accounts, but the private business transactions
of the citizens, whose neighbors are often the gods themselves,
as direct land-owners. In Assyrian times the mention
of temple lands is very common. In later Babylonian
times there is abundant evidence of the same custom. Dr.
Peiser devotes a considerable portion of the introduction to
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylonische VertrÃ¤ge</span></span> to this subject. How the temple
became possessed of these lands we do not know. We
do know of large gifts of land by kings, rich land-owners
and the like, but we do not know whether originally the
temple started with land. When a king speaks of building
a temple to a god, we may understand that he really rebuilt
it, or erected a new temple on the site. Before kings,
the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">patÃªsis</span></span> did the
same. But did a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">patÃªsi</span></span> precede a
temple or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versÃ¢</span></span>? and did the first founder, or the
town, grant the first temple lands?

The temples had further a variable revenue from private
sources. There were many gifts and presents given voluntarily,
often as thank-offerings. The temple accounts give
extensive lists of these from the earliest times to the latest.
They were of all sorts, most often food or money. But
they were often accompanied by some permanent record, a
tablet, vase, stone or metal vessel, inscribed with a votive
inscription. These form our only materials for history in
long spaces of time.

Sacrifices were, of course, largely consumed by the
offerers and those invited to share the feast. But the temple
took its share. The share was a fixed or customary
right to certain parts. For one example, the temple of
Shamash at Sippara had its fixed share of the sacrifice,
taking <span class="tei tei-q">âthe loins, the hide, the rump, the tendons, half the
abdominal viscera and half the thoracic viscera, two legs,
and a pot of broth.â</span> The usage was not the same at all

This was of course a variable source of income, depending

The temple was also a commercial institution of high efficiency.
Their accumulations of all sorts of raw products
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were enormous. The temple let out or advanced all kinds
of raw material, usually on easy terms. To the poor, as
a charity, advances were made in times of scarcity or personal
want, to their tenants as part of the metayer system
of tenure, to slaves who lived outside its precincts,
and to contractors who took the material on purely commercial
terms. The return was expected in kind, to the
full amount of advance, or with stipulated interest. Also in
some cases, especially wool and other clothing stuffs, in made-up
material. Definite fabrics, mostly garments and rugs or
hangings, were expected back. Some quantity was needed
for garments and vestments for temple officials, some for
the gods. But a great deal was used for trade. We have
references to temple treasuries and storehouses from the
earliest times to the latest.

The temples did a certain amount of banking business.
By this we mean that they held money on deposit against
the call of the depositor. Whether they charged for safekeeping
or remunerated themselves by investing the bulk
of their capital, reserving a balance to meet calls, does not
yet appear. But the relatively large proportion of loans,
where the god is said to be owner of the money, points to
investment as the source of a considerable income. Here a
careful distinction must be made between the loans without
interest, or with interest only charged in default of
payment to time, and those where interest is charged at
once. The latter are banking business, the former were
probably only the landlord's bounden duty to his tenant
by the custom of his tenure. The temples also bought and
sold for profit.

The king, by his religion, could do nothing without religious
sanction. The support of the priestly party was essential.
In the more unsettled times they were to a great
extent king-makers. To estrange the priests was a dangerous
policy always. Besides their immense wealth they
had the sanctions of religion on their side. To all men
certain things were right, and the priests then had what
right there was on their side. A king was under obligation
to come to Babylon to take the hands of BÃªl-Merodach
each New Year's Day. If he did not, he not only
offended the priests, but also committed a wrong in the
eyes of his people.

But the kings were often inclined to rely upon conjurers,
soothsayers, magicians, and the like. It would be a fatal
mistake to confuse these with the priests. The best kings
were those who set their face against magic and supported
the more rational local or national worships. Sargon II.,
Esarhaddon, Nebuchadrezzar II., are examples of the latter,
while AshurbÃ¢nipal is a great example of the magic-ridden
kings. á¸¤ammurabi apparently strove to put down magic.
The eternal struggle between the <span class="tei tei-q">âscienceâ</span> (falsely so-called)
of magic and divination on the one hand and the higher
claims of religious duty on the other, is the key to much
that is misunderstood in the politics of the time. It would
be too much to say that the priestly party were always on
the side of morality, or that they were not often allied with
the soothsayers, but it is certain that what ethical progress
there was, was due to them. In religious texts alone have
we aspiration after higher ideals. Who can fancy a wizard
troubled about ethics?

Hence arose property in temple incomes. That these

From them we learn that each day certain officials received
certain allowances, mostly food and drink. From later documents

the temple had become lay impropriators of the temple allowances
originally intended only for temple officers.

The position of a priest, or other official, carried with it
an endowment. On this point the Code is very explicit for
the cases of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ridÃ» á¹£Ã¢bÃª</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ¢'iru</span></span>, officials charged
with the collection of local quotas for the army and public
works. They were recruiting sergeants, press-gang officers,
and post-office officials. The office was endowed by royal
grant. They were liable to be called on in the discharge of
their duties to make lengthy journeys and be absent from
home for a length of time, even years. In their absence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their duties could be delegated to a son, if old enough, otherwise
a substitute was put in. They could claim reinstatement
within a certain time. But their endowment was inalienable
from the office and could not be treated as private
property.

Quite similarly the great state officials in Assyria had
endowments which were not personal, but went with the
office. Thus we learn from the á¸¤arran census that certain
lands paid rent or crops to certain offices.

In later times the rights to income are very prominent,
perhaps solely in virtue of the class of documents which has
reached us. Occasionally we are able to learn exactly what
they were. For example, the surveyor for the temple of
Anu had a right to two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn,
two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of dates,
fifty <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span> of wheat, six

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span> of land. When the corn and dates were harvested, on
one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span>, six <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span> were levied.

It is not clear that a temple had any direct duties to the
state. Peiser thinks that they collected dues for the state.
Certainly they had attached to them the king's storehouses.
Certain amounts were paid in for certain state officials. In
the Code of á¸¤ammurabi we see that a temple might be
called upon to ransom a member of the town who had been
taken captive.

Some kings laid hands on the treasures of the temple
for their own use. Doubtless this was done under bond to
repay. The cases in which we read of such practices are
always represented as a wrong. When Shamash-shÃ»m-ukÃ®n
sent the bribes to the King of Elam, Ummanigash, he spoiled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the treasuries of Merodach at Babylon, of NabÃ» at Borsippa,
and of NÃªrgal at Cutha, and this was reckoned one of his
evil deeds, which led to his downfall. But if he had been
successful and had repaid his forced loans, doubtless it
would have been excused, and his memory would have been
blessed.

Much confusion is introduced by the fact that we do not
know when a temple official acts in his own private capacity
and when on behalf of the temple. The deeds, which
do not expressly state that the money or property belongs
to the god, or the temple, may often be only concerned
with private transactions, but were preserved in the temple
archives on account of the official position of the parties.
But there are plenty of cases, where no doubt exists, to
justify us in regarding the temple as acting in all the capacities
of a private individual, or a firm of traders.

Of complete alienation we may instance donation, sale, exchange,

We may note as a common mark of all these transactions
the care taken to fix and define ownership. The transfer is
<span class="tei tei-q">âfromâ</span> A to B. In early times the property is usually
first stated to belong to A. Then he is often said in Assyrian
times to be the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃªlu</span></span> of it, its full and legitimate
owner. The new owner had to be satisfied that A was competent to
part with it. This is often made clearer by saying, in later
times, that no one else has any claim upon it. Hence arise
guarantees against defeasor, redemptor, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et cetera</span></span>. This subject
of guarantees is most interesting, though often obscure.
The investigation of the varied rights which were likely to
interfere with freedom of transfer is most important.

have also a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">donatio retento

of the property. Here also certain rights may be
reserved against the ultimate possessor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another interesting point is that property may be credited

Undoubtedly men were at liberty in daily life to make
presents one to another. But the rights of the family were
so strong that for the most part all the property of the
parents was jealously regarded as tied to the children, or
other legal heirs. When a man died, his property was divided
according to a rigid law of inheritance. When a
woman left her father's house to be married, the father gave
her the share of his goods which fell to her, without waiting
until his death to divide his substance. In this case she
had nothing further at his death. But the property was
not her husband's, though he and she shared its use; it was
entailed to her children. If she had none, it went back to
her father's house: to her brothers, if she had any, or to her
father's other heirs. Unless a man legally adopted his
natural sons, they did not inherit. Hence neither man nor
woman was wholly free to give. But, hedged about with
consents and reservations, donations took place.

A daughter might be portioned off for marriage and this
involved a gift, which might be treated as a donation, but
rather comes under the head of marriage-portion, in the
chapter on marriage. Precisely the same portioning took
place when the daughter either became a votary or was dedicated
to the service of a god. Such gifts may be included
here. They usually contain a list of property: sharing
houses, land, slaves, jewels, money, clothes, household furniture,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even pots of honey or jars of wine. As a rule, in
our present state of knowledge, nothing that could pretend
to be an accurate translation can be given of the items of
such a gift, only a general idea of the nature of the whole.
Such a gift, however, evidently set the lady up in an establishment
of her own, with all she could require for maintenance
and comfort for the rest of her life.

A modified freedom is allowed by a father who gives his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A different sort of gift is where the donor reserves to himself
a use of the property as long as he lives, or stipulates
for a life allowance from it. These are usually accompanied
by formal adoption. The recipient is one who has not
already a claim to inherit, but undertakes the care or maintenance
of the donor. Such gifts are best classed under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
adoption, even where the fact of adoption is not stated.
When a parent makes an arrangement of this kind with a
son or daughter, these were possibly adopted by a previous
act. At any rate, it seems likely that such a child was
either unmarried or again free to wait upon the donor.
But whatever the actual state of relationships, we find a
mother giving property to a daughter, reserving the use of
it as long as she lives.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> Similarly a brother undertakes

Testamentary devolution of property was not the rule in
Assyria or Babylonia, where the law of inheritance was so
firmly fixed that it would be naturally illegal. As a rule,
children did not inherit under their fathers' will, but by
right. However, the Code allows a father to give his married
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

least some of his property. The very frequent cases of
adoption, where the adopted child becomes heir, on condition
of supporting the parent as long as he lives, and the

the chief points are these: A married B and they had a
daughter C, who married D. The son of C and D is the
testator. He leaves to his father D all the property which
he inherited from A and B, which they had left to their
daughter's son. It consisted of a house, fields, and slaves.
He leaves it to his father <span class="tei tei-q">âforever,â</span> only he is to retain

Alienation of property in perpetuity was a matter for
serious consideration, where all property was as much that
of the family as of the individual. A change of ownership,

the neighbors. Hence the deeds of sale are imposing
documents. Whether the object sold was a piece of
land, a house, or a slave, the same general treatment was
accorded to it.

There were the same formalities as in all deeds. First
the purchaser approached the vendor and there was an
interchange of ideas, often through a third party, prolonged
over a considerable space of time. When etiquette had
been satisfied and all the preliminary haggling was over, the
parties agreed upon a scribe, who was made acquainted with
the terms of the sale, already verbally agreed upon, and he
set down in the imperishable clay the legal instrument
which should bind the parties to their contract forever.

Undoubtedly both parties took a copy, and it seems clear
that a third was deposited in the temple archives as a sort
of registration of title. It seems probable that each party
sealed the copy held by the other, but this surmise awaits
confirmation. As a rule, the same seal seems to have been
used for all copies, and the witnesses in early times also affixed
their seals. A more exhaustive study must be made
before this can be regarded as certain. Even where duplicates

As a rule, the scribe followed a very definite plan. First
he made clear the identity of the property. This was the
specification. In the case of land, neighbors were set down,
boundaries given, in some cases the size of the plot. In
each sale the specification is very important. The personal
identity of the parties was usually sufficiently fixed by
appending to their names those of their fathers. In many
cases, the office or rank held by a party is added. Occasionally
the name of the grandfather, or clan-father is
added. When either party was a stranger, his nationality,
or city, or tribe, is given. As a rule, the same information
is attached to the names of witnesses. These notes of personal
identity are very valuable, for they furnish means for
reconstructing long genealogies, and they throw much light
on the intercourse of varied peoples. Babylonia seems
always to have had a very mixed population.

Having made it impossible for any mistake to arise as to
the property sold or the parties concerned, the scribe proceeded
to guard against errors regarding the nature of the
transaction. The house or other property <span class="tei tei-q">âwas sold,â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âthe
money paid,â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âin full,â</span> and so on. Then he sought to
make it clear that there could be no withdrawal from the
bargain, nor after-claims raised. There was danger that the
family might put in a claim to the property. An illustration
of this is a suit brought to reclaim a house sold,
which was the claimant's reversionâan actual redemption
of ancestral property. From such perils the buyer was
protected by heavy penalties on the seller, who in fact engaged
to indemnify him.

These and many other complicated questions must have
long been the subject of consideration in Babylonian legal

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

In this particular case the words within quotation marks
are written in Sumerian. The variations are slight as a
rule, but enough to show that the scribe understood what
he wrote and could make correct changes when needful.
The use of such a large amount of Sumerian in these deeds,
along with Semitic names and specifications, has often
been compared to the retention of Latin words in the body
of legal documents in European countries, almost to the
present day. It will be noted that this portion constitutes
the formal body of the document, and might well have been
kept ready written, blanks being left to fill in the names
and specifications. It is not, however, easy to find proof
that this was done in early times.

Somewhat later, in the time of the First Dynasty, a number

by their Semitic equivalent. Indeed, some deeds are Semitic
only. We can by comparison make a fairly complete
study of Sumerian legal terms. To some extent this was
already done by the scribes who drew up the series of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Very interesting are the references to earnest money, or the
gift presented to close the bargain. As early as the time of
Manistusu<a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> we find not only a price paid, but also a present

most varied and valuable nature.<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> As already pointed out

in the purchase of a slave for four and a half
shekels, a little present of fifteen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Å E</span></span>, or one-twelfth of
a shekel, was thus added. Likewise when another slave
and her baby were sold we find that in addition to the price
of eighty-four shekels, one shekel is thrown in as a present.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> I do not recall the occurrence of this custom in Assyrian
times, but in the later Babylonian documents it is common.
There it is often referred to as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">atru</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-q">âover-plus.â</span> Thus we find that in the sale of a house
in the time of Nebuchadrezzar III.,<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a> besides the <span class="tei tei-q">âfull agreed price,â</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡Ã®mu
gamrÃ»tu</span></span>, of half a mina of silver, the buyer gave one shekel
of silver, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kÃ® atri</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âas an addition,â</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">âa dress for the lady of the house.â</span> The whole payment thus made of thirty-one
shekels was called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡ibirtu</span></span>. So in the time of
Darius (?) we find that, in addition to the full price of three
minas, five shekels of silver, the buyer adds, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kÃ® atri</span></span>,
six shekels of silver and a dress for the lady of the house, making
three minas, eleven shekels of silver as the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or simply to a price of two minas of bright silver he adds
two shekels, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kÃ® pÃ® atar</span></span>,
making a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡ibirtu</span></span> of two minas, two
shekels of bright silver.<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a>

Equally interesting are the sums charged as fees to the
scribe. This was paid to him expressly for obtaining the
seller's seal or nail-mark as a conclusion of the contract.<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href="#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a>
Thus at the end of a deed of sale of a single male slave,
executed by three owners by affixing three impressions of
the same seal, and drawn up by one scribe, we read <span class="tei tei-q">âSeven
shekels of silver for their seal.â</span> The price was about one
hundred and forty shekels. Thus the scribe received a fee
of five per cent. on the sale price.<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a> The ratio was not constant.
It might be as low as two per cent. Thus in the
case of a sale of a slave by two owners, who made four nail-marks
in lieu of seals, we read <span class="tei tei-q">âone mina of bronze for
their nail-marks.â</span> There was but one scribe, and the price
was fifty minas of bronze.<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a> Hence we cannot think that
this fee was paid for the scribe's seal, as some have done.
The seal, or nail-mark, was not <span class="tei tei-q">âthe authenticating subscription
by the notary,â</span> but by the seller.

In Assyrian times the deed of sale was a much longer
document. The same general form is observed, but the
document starts with a heading giving the information that
the seller had sealed the document, or, in the absence of a
seal, had impressed his nail-mark. No one but the seller
ever seals or impresses his nail-mark. The seller is usually
described as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃªlu</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-q">âlegitimateâ</span> owner of the property
made over. Then first after the seal, or in a space left for
it, comes the specification of the property. Next it is stated
that the buyer has made a bargain and taken the property
for so much. But the bulk of the document is devoted to
a contract that the seller, his representatives, heirs, and assigns,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall never rescind the sale, or bring any suit to recover
possession, under specified and heavy penalties. The
wording of these passages recalls most strikingly the imprecations
of the kings in their charters upon those who, in
after times, should dare to render their gifts inoperative.
This grand style is one of the many indications that for the
Assyrian period most of the deeds we have were drawn up
on behalf of the king's household.

It is usually stated that the purchase is complete, the full
price paid and delivery of possession made. But in some
cases this was a mere conventional statement, and both payment
and delivery were delayed. There was to be no return
of the goods, no turning back from the bargain; the
pleading of a suit of nullity of sale is expressly barred. It
is of interest to notice who were regarded as competent, or
likely to take action to recover the property. Sons, grandsons,
brothers, brothers' sons, are all named. The enumeration
clearly included females of the same nearness of kinship.
Sisters are actually named. All these relatives are
included in the term <span class="tei tei-q">âhis people.â</span> In some cases the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡aknu</span></span>, or governor
of the district, is named, especially where
slaves are sold, or the estate involved the transfer of serfs.
The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡aknu</span></span> clearly had rights over lands and slaves
within his district. The transfer of property might act injuriously
to his rights. It was usual to stipulate that he had no such
rights. How they had been annulled we do not know.
Perhaps by some previous charter conferring exemption.
The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸«azÃ¢nu</span></span> also appears to have had the right to
intervene. The country seems to have been split up into districts
which were called on to furnish fifty units, each consisting
of an archer and a spearman or shield-bearer. Hence, the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rab á¸«anÅ¡Ã¢</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-q">âcaptain of fifty,â</span> was really in command of
a hundred men. Whether this obligation lay on a group
of a hundred families or not, it is clear that the transfer of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ownership of land might lead to embarrassment of the official.
Hence, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rab á¸«anÅ¡Ã¢</span></span> was likely to intervene also.
There was service on public works also concerned in the
matter. Whatever official was <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃªl ilki</span></span>, or had right to
<span class="tei tei-q">âthe levy,â</span> might intervene. The chief of a certain district
was called a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rab kiá¹£ir</span></span>; he was also commander of a
section of the army, and he had the right to intervene.
Other officials as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡Ã¢piru</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸³urbu</span></span>, are named, but in all
cases the nature of the claim must have been similar. The
object of the buyer was to stipulate that the seller should
hold him exempt from such claims. How this could be
done does not appear.

The oath to observe the contract made between the
parties still appears, but is not common. As before, these
oaths are of interest, for the light which they throw upon
local cults. The gods were invoked as being the avengers
of wrong. The decision of the king was also still regarded
as a source of vengeance, since he was bound to see right
done.

The penalties most commonly invoked were payments to
the treasury of a temple. These were in the nature of forfeits.
The sum set down in the deed rarely bears any exact
relation to the value of the property, but is merely a large
amount. Usually, a sum in both silver and gold is stated,
but no relation between the relative worths of the metals
can be deduced. The forfeit might take the form of presenting
two or more white horses to the god. In a few
cases, the penalty consisted in the devotion of a child, usually
the eldest son or daughter, to a god. The verb used
for <span class="tei tei-q">âdevotingâ</span> a child literally means to <span class="tei tei-q">âburn.â</span> This
seems to point to an earlier sacrifice of children by fire. But
variants show that it was now used in a more general sense
of dedication. The <span class="tei tei-q">âcedar wood of Ishtarâ</span> is named as
the spot where a daughter was to be dedicated. Further,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other objects might be dedicated as a forfeit. A great
bow of bronze to Ninip of Kalá¸«u is named.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A deterrent penalty was to return the price <span class="tei tei-q">âtenfoldâ</span> to
the seller. Once or twice the penalty is <span class="tei tei-q">âtwelvefold.â</span> A
further penalty was to pay a talent of lead to the governor
of the city or state. Very curious is the penalty of being
required to eat a mina of some food, possibly a magical compound,
and drink an <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">agannu</span></span> pot of some drink. That this
drink was taken from a bowl inscribed with magical formulÃ¦
seems to be the best way of reading the signs. The
penalty was, therefore, an ordeal. Then, if the contention
was right, the plaintiff would be immune; if he was merely
litigious, perhaps he would be sick or even die.

Finally, it is often laid down that, if either party (especially
the seller) shall attempt to bring a suit about the
property, the judge shall not hear him, or if he insists,
he shall lose the action. Throughout it is clear that the
buyer tries to make the seller contract to waive all rights to
recover his property, but he holds to certain rights of his
own. Thus, in the sale of slaves, a clause is frequently inserted
which claims a hundred days within which to set up
a claim to repudiate the purchase, on the ground that
the slave is afflicted with certain diseases, the
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¹£ibtu</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bennu</span></span>,
the character of which is not exactly known. Also
he bargains that a blemish may be at any time an excuse for
annulling the bargain. These really amount to demanding
a guarantee from the seller that the slave was free from disease
or other undisclosed weakness.<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a>

The later Babylonian tablets do not illustrate much that
is of great interest. They often record the initial verbal
discussion. Thus we find that when A bought of B, some
phrase like the following is recorded: A said thus to B:

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Sales usually were for the full price, or the agreed price,
paid down at once. This is expressly stated. But in the
later Babylonian times we have some examples of deferred
payment, which may also have been common during earlier

received twenty-five shekels as advance price. The rest

soon. Thus we find a lady selling four female slaves to a
certain man and taking a bond of him to pay four shekels,
the balance of the price, on the second of Kislev, a week
later.<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> The interval might be

Here are many noteworthy pieces of information. The
price of corn is fixed with relation to silver. It remained
the same down to late Babylonian times. A present was
given in addition to the price, as in many sales even to the
latest times. The serfs go with the land. Certain food and
money allowances are reserved to the priest C and his descendants.
This was probably a territorial charge. Many
other points of interest are furnished by the other sections.
Thus, among the presents given are numerous vessels of
gold, silver, and copper. The garments are of various
kinds. The men who receive presents do not appear to be
merely the sellers, but also elders of the city or district. This
indicates a tribal or district right of control over the alienation
of land. The boundaries of the estates are often given
and are of great interest for topography. A number of persons
are named as witnesses to the separate sales. In one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
way or another some five hundred persons and about forty
places are named. Over forty titles or names of professions
are given. Among them we note many familiar in
later times, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">abrakku</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nagiru</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">patÃªsi</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å akkanak</span></span>, as well
as a king. We see already judges, merchants, scribes, irrigators,
boatmen, carpenters, singers, shepherds, seers, branders,
as well as slaves. We read of sheep, asses, goats, oxen.
And all this from one inscription. It is a fine example of
the kind of information this class of documents may afford.
Not least in importance is the fact that many Semitic, as
well as Sumerian, names and words occur.

In the case of landed property the deeds of sale usually
specify its position. In the case of fields and gardens four
neighbors are often specified. Their plots of land then
completely enclosed the plot concerned. What rights of
access to such a plot existed does not appear, but where the
boundaries were low mounds or ridges, it may be assumed
that the tops of these were common to all for access and carriage.
In towns, more usually three neighbors are named,
the fourth side is often said to be on the street. Sometimes
four neighbors are given for a house, but then an exit,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mÃ»á¹£Ã»</span></span>, is specified, which doubtless means a right of
way through, or past, another house to the street. When more than four
neighbors are named, it is probably the case that on one
side the plot was conterminous, at least partly, with two of
them. Very commonly only two neighbors are given, one
each side. We may then presume that there were streets
or lanes both front and back. If we could press the term
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bÃ®tu</span></span> to mean <span class="tei tei-q">âhouse,â</span> we might conclude from many
cases that the old Babylonian cities contained streets of houses,
which were one conterminous block of buildings. But they
seem in very many cases to have had some open ground,
and often gardens were attached.

to consult all the documents which were once stored in the
archives of one great temple, we might map out a city and
assign each plot to its owner; and then extend our map
and the names of owners to the fields and plantations
which lay around the city. For outside the city walls
the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ugaru</span></span> or town-land extended to a considerable
distance from the city walls. We may even soon be able
to determine what was the approximate extent of this

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸³ablu</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-q">âgirdle.â</span>

Usually the plots are said to be in a city whose name is
given. Thus we conclude the close proximity of Laá¸«Ã®,
Ishkun-Ishtar, Malgia, á¸¤alá¸«alla, to Sippara. Indeed, they
were probably conterminous with it. Often the plot is
stated to be in some quarter, or ward of the city. For the
most part the names of these wards, as for example Gagim,
Karim, are difficult to understand. Why or how they obtained
these names we cannot tell. It is noteworthy that
one ward was called Amurru, <span class="tei tei-q">âthe Amorite land.â</span> Much
has been made of this by Professors Hommel and Sayce,
but we are still far from clear ideas on the point. With
respect to other indications of locality, it must be noted
that they are usually at the end of the first line at the
right-hand top corner of the tablet, and have suffered defacement
more often than any other detail, so that they
are often illegible.

From many considerations it appears that most of
these plots were rectangular, but it is curious to note
that many plans of houses and fields exist which show
that this was not always the case. Perhaps it was the
irregularity of the outline which made plans necessary
and they may be an indirect witness to the rarity of such
a feature.

As a rule the private houses seem to have been small and
to have had a few small rooms. The palaces, or mansions
of the great, had much more extensive conveniences. One
reads of several specially defined rooms, but their names do
not as a rule tell us much of their use. Wash-houses, shops,
stables, granaries, and vacant plots, as well as gardens and
orchards, are often attached. Apparently one had to leave
the house to enter these. The houses were built of brick
and their roofs were supported by strong beams. In many
plans, while the doorways for internal communication are
carefully marked, there seems to be no access from the
street. Perhaps this is a peculiarity of the architect's ideas
of a plan, the door to the street being understood. At any
rate, doors, bolts, posts, and a lintel are frequently named.
These were often put in by the tenant and, like the beams,
taken away by him. A door might be pledged alone. But
it is possible that some houses had no door proper, being
entered by steps leading to the roof. This may be the explanation
of the oft-mentioned <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mÃ»á¹£Ã»</span></span> or right of way out,
either between, through, or over, other house property.
When a house had other houses touching it on each of four
sides, something of the kind was necessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Probably the house did not usually have an upper story;
but, perhaps, as a remarkable exception, an <span class="tei tei-q">âupper houseâ</span>
is occasionally mentioned. There is reason to think that
some were in the form of a quadrangle, around an inner
court; as there are wells, or fountains, mentioned as being
<span class="tei tei-q">âwithin the house.â</span> In some parts of the city, at any rate,
the block of buildings was continuous. But there were
many streets, and canals also, in the cities. The streets,
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">suá¸³Ãª</span></span>, were as a rule only narrow lanes or passages. As
shown by the excavations at Nippur, houses stood for a long
time. When first used, the floors were above the street
level, but after the footpaths had been some time in use,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they rose to the level of, and finally above, the floor, so that
there were steps leading down into the house.<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems evident that great efforts were made to provide
drains for the foundations; and perhaps other sanitary
appliances were found in the better class of houses. But
we must await more extensive exploration, not necessarily
in the more important mounds, before we are able to give
a clear account of an ancient Babylonian house.

In the sale of a house it was often stated that the house
was in good condition.<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> In this respect many particulars
might be recited, or the whole summed up in one concise
phrase. In the early Babylonian documents no good example
is yet published in which all the points are mentioned.
We must refer to an example of Assyrian times,<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> where all
the chief points occur together. Early Babylonian tablets
mention nearly all of these items, but only one or two at a
time. Thus we have a note that the beams and doors are
sound. Wood was scarce, and a tenant usually stipulated
to take away the beams and doors, if he put them in. The
fact that a man might pledge a door<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a> suggests that the
modern theory of interchangeable parts was anticipated in
Babylonia, so that a door would as a rule fit any house.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
What the beams were for is far from clear. To carry screens
or curtains of skins over a central court seems most likely.
Actual roof-beams were probably included in the <span class="tei tei-q">âroofâ</span>
itself, which is mentioned separately from the beams. The
threshold, or perhaps, rather, the lintel of the doorway, may
be meant; and, with the door-posts, be included under
beams. The bolt or crossbar of the door is often associated
with these beams.

main street of Sippara, or only one principal thoroughfare, is
not always clear. Streets are often named after a god; thus
the street of Lugal-amgaba, of Ishtar, of Bunene, of BÃªlit-nuá¸«shi

<span class="tei tei-q">âking of the four quarters,â</span> a title

It is not necessary to suppose him still alive. This deed

The phrase <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ina Å¡apiriÅ¡a</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âby her order,â</span> occurs

borrowed the lead, she acted through a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mÃ¢r Å¡ipri</span></span>,
a messenger and agent. She bought her other house in the same
way. This does not imply any disability on the part of
women to enter into business, for they were as free and
competent to act as men. Nor does it arise from her being
a votary of Shamash, for these ladies are concerned in by far
the larger part of the transactions recorded at Sippara. It
is merely the fact that on these occasions, as was frequently
done, Lamazi employed a business agent, who is not named.
Her father, Kasha-Upi, is referred to again as buying a
house from the sons of Nabi-ilushu,<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a> where we learn that the
latter was a son of Shamash-ina-mÃ¢tim and brother of Kasha-Upi.
Lamazi was therefore a niece of Nabi-ilushu.

those in Sippara. But variation was probably even more
due to situation and size. The lowest price per <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">SAR</span></span> was

press these statements to mean <span class="tei tei-q">âwithin the wallsâ</span> of those

The characteristic word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Å U-BA-TI</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Å U-BA-AN-TI</span></span>, which

given for the loans by the borrowers. Here is an example:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In place of corn we may have money, dates, wool, or
almost anything. Sometimes a date for repayment is given.
In the examples there are usually no references to the interest
to be paid for the loan. They may be regarded as
advances made to temple tenants, or serfs, to be repaid at
harvest from crops.

The greatest value of these tablets lies in their dates.
The dates are usually events. Many of these have already
been collected and registered, especially by Dr. H. Radau.<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a>
But there is even more to be done, when further examples
are published. Many tablets contain two dates referring
to loans contracted at different times. By this means the
sequence can gradually be determined. The seals are also
of great interest and often of value, as may be seen from
Dr. Radau's work.

without interest. For convenience we may separate money
from corn loans and advances of all kinds of commodities;
but we must not forget that corn, at any rate, was legal
tender; and silver loans might be repaid in corn. This,
however, was early recognized as an inconvenience and it is
quite common to find a direct stipulation that what was
lent shall be repaid in kind. It soon became usual to state
that if the loan was repaid otherwise, it must be according
to a fixed ratio between silver and corn.

A very large number of loans take the form of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abstract
schuldscheine</span></span>, loans without statement of any cause for the
debt. They are merely promises to pay, that is, acknowledgments
of indebtedness. Thus we read: <span class="tei tei-q">âFive shekels
of silver which A has given to B. On such a date B shall
pay five shekels of silver to A.â</span> A penalty may be added
for not paying on the fixed date. Usually this takes the
form of interest. The rate is one shekel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per mina</span></span> each
month, or twelve shekels <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per mina yearly</span></span>, that is, twenty
per cent. There is no clear case of money lent as an investment
to bear interest. That was done in quite another way.
The lender entered into relationship with an agent, to whom
he furnished capital and who traded with the money and
repaid it with interest.

Most of the loans were evidently contracted to meet
temporary embarrassment. Usually it was in connection
with the need of cash to pay the expenses at harvest-time.
The loan was then repaid at harvest. It might be repaid
in corn.<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a> The time was usually shortâfifteen days is

The lender had his reward in obtaining his money's
worth in corn, when its price was cheapest. But he was
evidently not expected to charge interest. A similar kind
of loan is half a mina of silver to pay the price of a piece of
land. Here the money was lent until the land was bought,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and was to be repaid with interest of three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of

Another reason for borrowing was the need of money to
pay taxes, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana ilkim

Here the <span class="tei tei-q">âsealed tabletâ</span> is in one case the receipt for the
tax, in the other the receipt which the borrower gave for
his loan. But there is no mention of his repayment. Perhaps
the lender owed the tax, half a mina, and as it was a
considerable sum, sent it by a third party, but made him
give a receipt for it. But such a receipt would differ in no
respect from the sort of bond mentioned above, and would
render the messenger liable to repay the money; so he was
to have his receipt back, on handing over the tax-collector's
receipt showing that he had paid the tax.

In several cases the god is represented as lending the
money. It is obvious that such advances were made from
the temple treasury.<a id="noteref_653" name="noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> It is usual from such instances to
expatiate on the temple, or the priests, as the great moneylenders.
This is a view easily misunderstood. It is quite
true that the temples were great landowners, and had steady
incomes, and possessed treasuries; but there is no evidence
that they lent on usury. It seems rather that these loans
without interest (except as a fine for undue retention
of the loan) were a kindly accommodation. We know that
under certain circumstances a man might appeal to the
temple treasury to ransom him from the enemy. He might
also borrow in case of necessity without interest. Moneylending
proper existed, but was kept in narrow bounds by
the temple itself.

In view of the many questions that arise as to the nature
of the money at this period, it should be noted that the silver
is often said to be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kanku;</span></span> literally <span class="tei tei-q">âsealed.â</span>
Whether this means that the silver bars, or ingots, were sealed while
the metal was soft enough to receive a mark which would
authenticate its weight and purity, or whether it means that
the money was enclosed in sealed sacks, is hard to say.
Against the latter may be urged that such a small sum as
one and two-thirds shekels would not be sealed
up.<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href="#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> But it

In the second case only one of the former debtors is left.
The loan was partly repaid, a fresh loan contracted, and
then partly repaid. It is not clear whether the arrears were

Another fairly common type of document contains a
number of sections, each containing the record of one sum.
But it is not clear that these were loans. They may be allowances
for food or salary. Thus in B<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">1</span></span> 247 we have so
much corn for the women weavers, so much more for the
votaries, so much for other officials, from the first of one
month to the thirtieth, so much for the SutÃ® who was watching
the field, so much for a boatman, and so on. These are
perhaps a temple steward's accounts. Their interest lies
only in the incidental notices. We also note that here a
month had thirty days. It is interesting to find that the
celebrated SutÃ® nomads who later gave so much trouble,
were already in the country and were employed to watch
the fields. Was this watching done on the principle of <span class="tei tei-q">âsetting

employ a SutÃ® as custodian, of course at a salary, if one was

In the Assyrian examples of money-loans the same general

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana pÃ»á¸«i</span></span>, which may be taken to mean <span class="tei tei-q">âfor

<span class="tei tei-q">âexchange.â</span> But there is never
any statement of what the consideration was. Some have
thought, that as the bond was invariably given to the creditor
to be broken up on the repayment of the loan, the
exchange referred to was a restoration of the bond in return
for the money. But the consideration, which is a legal
presumption, may have lain in the fact that the borrowers
were tenants on the metayer system and had a right to borrow
of their landlord, free of interest, at seed-time and harvest.
On such loans interest is only demanded when the
debtor fails to repay at the fixed date.

loans of corn</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One peculiarity of the corn loans is that they are chiefly
recorded upon what have been called heart-shaped tablets.
These were lumps of clay through which a string passed
and came out at the upper shoulders. The string was
probably tied around the neck of a sack containing the
corn. They thus served both as labels, seals, and as bonds.
Many of them have Aramaic dockets, which have been collected
and edited by Dr. J. H. Stevenson, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assyrian
and Babylonian Contracts, with Aramaic reference-notes</span></span>.

legends, in the case of such labels, may have served as addresses.
But the general purpose is obscure. All the corn
advances seem to have been made by officials of the royal
household to inferior officers, in charge of farms or otherwise
dependent for supplies.

They show by their dates that the corn was usually advanced
just before harvest, when corn was dearest. Some
of them name the reapers; others give the number of them.
We conclude that these advances were made as food for the
harvesters, or as wages for their labor. Occasionally, however,
the loan was made at seed-time. Most of the loans are

Very little is known about pledges in early times,

passages of the series <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana ittiÅ¡u</span></span>,
such as <span class="tei tei-q">âon account of the interest of his money he shall cause house, field, garden,
man-servant, or maid-servant, to stand on depositâ</span>; followed
later by, <span class="tei tei-q">âif he bring back the money he can re-enter his
house; if he bring back the money, he can plant his garden
again; if he bring back the money, he can stand in his field;
if he bring back the money, he can take away his maid; if
he bring back the money, one shall return his slave.â</span><a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a>
Consequently the creditor held the pledge in his possession
until the loan was returned, when he had to give it back.
The pledges here mentioned are antichretic, that is, such
that they produce an income or return to the holder, which
is a set-off against the interest of his money.

upon the goods of the debtor, in case of non-payment, than
a case of pledge. Since it was usually expected that the
property so taken would be returned on payment of the
debt, we can hardly distinguish it from pledge. Indeed,
where a debtor gave up his wife, child, or slave to work off
a debt, we have a case of antichretic pledge for the debt
and interest.

In times subsequent to the First Babylonian Dynasty,
the pledge is common. As a rule, it is antichretic, such that
income or profit derived from the pledge is a fair equivalent
for the interest of the loan. The lender acquires the right
of enjoying the pledge. As a rule this is assigned him absolutely,
so that no account is needed to be kept of interest
on one side and profit on the other. If the profit exceeds
the interest due, the excess may be returned, or it may be
credited towards the discharge of the debt. If the interest
exceeds the profit on the pledge, then the amount by which
the loan exceeds the capitalized profit must pay interest.

In Assyrian times loans on security are fairly common.
Here also we have antichretic loans, where the profit on
the pledge was a set-off against the interest of the money.
The pledge is expressly stated to be <span class="tei tei-q">âin lieu of interest.â</span>
But it seems that the property was often expected also to
extinguish the debt. Or it was merely pledged, as a
security, which the creditor would keep in case he could
not get his money back. We may illustrate these by examples:<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a>

has a house in pledge. To him it is rent-free until the loan
is repaid. Hence the common phrase <span class="tei tei-q">ârent is nought,

one against the other.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> The creditor might not, however,
care to take the pledge in perpetuity against interest of a
loan, never repaid. Usually a date was fixed for repayment,
at which time the debtor was bound to take back
his pledge. Thus a house might be pledged definitely
for three years.<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a>

The value of the pledge might, however, be such that it
would outweigh both loan and interest. At any rate, it
should be as valuable as the loan. Hence it could not be
used as a further pledge to another. There is often a guarantee
that the pledge given has not been already pledged,
that no other creditor has a lien upon it.

In these cases the creditor enters into possession of the
pledge and enjoyment of it. He has some responsibilities
towards it. He cannot destroy it, or waste it. As a rule,
he assumed full liability for all cases for wear and tear.
He also fed and clothed a slave pledged to him. Now and
then we find the debtor responsible for clothing the slave
pledged by him.<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> It is not essential, however, to the

A common case is where the debtor pledges all he has to
the creditor, a pledge usually greatly in excess of the value
of the loan and its interest for a reasonable term, but remains
in possession himself. Hence the creditor has only a
right over the pledge, a lien upon it, but no usufruct. For
this he had the bond. This also gives only an eventual
possession.

We often meet with after-pledge. The creditor, being
in possession of the pledge, might traffic in its profits. If
he held a house as pledge, he was not bound to live in it,
but could sublet it. Hence he might pledge the rent of it.
Or he could repay himself his loan by repledging the house
to another. He could also pledge the loan which was due
to him. This makes a rather complicated case.

Such a transfer of the responsibility of D from L to C was

D wishes to get back. The following is a complicated case

L, who lived in it. Two others were guarantees that D would
repay the loan. The pledge was antichretic, <span class="tei tei-q">ârent nothing,

house to C. But he did not wish to vacate. So he hired it
of C, at such a rate that he would repay C's loan in about
five years. It is clear that this house was not good security
for C, since D might turn out L at any time by repaying
him. L would then owe money to C for which C had no
security at all. But L in addition pledged all his own
property, his slave, and all his goods in town and country.
Further, he not only pledged the house, but handed over
D's bond to him. C thus held the house in after-pledge,
and the advance with its security in pledge. He was
therefore amply secured, since D must pay him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now L died and was succeeded by his son M. L had
already paid nearly a third of his debt. M thus owed less
interest on the loan still due and was accepted by C as
tenant at a lower rent. By this means M really made a
small profit to himself. In three years M had paid off the
whole sum borrowed by his father, and due from him as heir
and executor, so he gave back his father's bond to C, also D's
bond to L. Now D paid back his loan to M. His bond to
L was destroyed. The claim of C on D was annulled, the
guarantees of D were free. A final deed of settlement was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
drawn up, in which C acknowledged that he had no claims
on D or M, nor on D's sureties. He had to say this, because
he was not only creditor to M, but as long as he held transferred
to him the pledge of D, and the credit of L, he was a
creditor with claims on D also. Further, M declares that
he has no credit on D.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>

A guarantee arises from certain persons undertaking to
fulfil a responsibility which is legally incumbent on another,
in case he fails to do so himself; or to secure that he shall
fulfil it himself. Thus, guarantees are very frequent at all
times, especially in the later Babylonian period, and are of
many different kinds.

A guarantee for debt was an additional security to the
creditor. Of course, the original debtor is the security that
the guarantor shall not lose. A good example showing all
sides is the following bond for three minas due from D to
L. G and W come in and guarantee that D will pay; if
not, they will. To protect themselves, they take as a pledge
of D some of his people. But D paid and received back
his people, so that the bond was returned to D.<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> Why D
did not give his people as pledge to L direct is not clear.
G and W were probably persons of greater credit and perhaps
related to D. The guarantor was sometimes called on
to pay. Thus G guarantees for D, is called on to pay and D
repays him.<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a> The guarantor was legally protected

A guarantee for appearance may have been only to come

It may be a guarantee that a man will
not go away; by which may be meant escape payment, or
fail to appear for judgment. This is called a guarantee

<span class="tei tei-q">âfor the foot ofâ</span> the person thus indorsed. The <span class="tei tei-q">âfootâ</span> is
said to be in the <span class="tei tei-q">âhandâ</span> of him who demands the guarantee.
It often refers to debt. G guarantees for the foot of
D, out of the hand of L. If he goes away, G will pay
thirty-five <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of dates. Here G is the mother of

So, probably on account of debt, G guarantees for the foot
of D, his son-in-law, from the hand of L;<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> again, G guarantees

does not come.<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> Or, G guarantees for D and E that they

A warrant against defects in a slave is very common.
The seller warrants that if the slave prove to have certain
undisclosed defects, vices, or liabilities, which would detract
from his value to the buyer, the seller will indemnify
the buyer. This indemnification seems to be effected by a
return of the purchase-money and accepting the slave back.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But, in some cases, the seller returned part of the purchase-money
according to a fixed scale of allowances. In the sale
of an estate, the seller guarantees that he will indemnify
the buyer in case of any defect of title to sell, or any lien
upon the estate.

Very common at all times was a personal guarantee not

times, are voluntary undertakings to forfeit stated sums, if
found attempting to go behind the contract.

As the pledge did not always leave the debtor's possession,
the creditor only had a lien upon it. Hence the giver of
the pledge had to guarantee that no creditor had a previous
lien upon it. This is also extremely common. A slave
pledged for debt might run away. His labor as the offset
against the interest was thus annulled. The borrower then
becomes liable for the interest lost to the creditor.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a>

Despite the existence of slaves, who were for the most
part domestic servants, there was considerable demand for
free labor in ancient Babylonia. This is clear from the
large number of contracts relating to hire which have come
down to us. The variability of the terms agreed upon is
witness for the existence of competition. As a rule, the
man was hired for the harvest and was free directly after.
But there are many examples in which the term of service
was differentâone month, half a year, or a whole year.

One might hire labor from the master of a slave, or from

the wages were small, a shekel or two. These wages were

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reapers for the harvest had half a shekel,<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> or two shekels,<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
each. The first may be the daily wages, the latter the

for ten days also represents the wages for the whole period.<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>

six shekels per year, according to the Code, and some actual
examples of contracts. But it was evidently a matter of
agreement, for we have rates as low as four shekels and as
high as eight. Usually the employer paid down a sum, for
example, a shekel, as earnest-money; the rest was paid by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a monthly or daily rate, or in a lump sum at the end of the
term of service. Occasionally the wages might be paid
down at the start, but this was rare and the amount less.

Very frequently, of course, the wages were paid in corn
instead of money. Many difficulties lie in the way of finding
an equivalent of the shekel in corn. Harvest labor was
probably far dearer than any other, because of its importance,
the skill and exertion demanded, and the fact that so
many were seeking for it at once. Further, after harvest,
when the wages were paid, corn was at its lowest price.
Meissner's actual examples show that two hundred and fifty
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span> might be accepted as yearly wages. We have such a
variety of rates that it is difficult to draw any clear conclusion,
but two young slaves at harvest could earn three hundred
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span>, and for a whole year the wages might be over six
hundred <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span>, or even as much as three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span>,
or nine hundred <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span>.<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> The Code
names ten <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸²A</span></span> as daily wages. The
average value of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn was a shekel, hence this
gives a yearly rate of twelve shekels. In this case we may
suppose that the laborer supported himself.

Thureau-Dangin in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revue d'Assyriologie</span></span>.<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> It belonged to
the King of á¸¤ana, whose seal it bears. His name was Isar-lim,
son of Idin-Kakka. The receiver was Kaki-Dagan's
son. The oath was by Shamash, Dagan, Idur-mÃªr and Isar-lim
the king. The names are very interestingâIgid-lim, an
official of the god AmurrÃ»; Idin-abu, king's son; Ili-esuá¸«, a
judge; Idin-Nani, son of Idin-Marduk; Sin-ukÃ»r, son of
Amur-sha-Dagan; Iazi-Dagan; á¹¬uri-Dagan; á¹¢illi-Shamash.
These prove that the land of á¸¤ana, already known by a
votive offering of one of its kings, Tukulti-mÃªr, was largely
Semitic. The names are either of the Babylonian or Aramaic
type. It is, of course, not easy to date, as the style
of writing in á¸¤ana may have been different from that in
Babylonia at the same epoch.

Meissner estimates the average rent of a house to be one
shekel per annum. But there are noteworthy variations
which, with our available data, cannot be explained. Perhaps
the best way is to take account of the size of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
house, usually given in the Babylonian fashion by the area
of its ground-plan. Rents were often paid in corn, but are
so variable that a value for corn in money cannot safely be
deduced.

A small part of the rent was usually paid as earnest-money
to close the bargain. In the case of short leases the
rest was paid on quitting the house, in longer leases half-yearly.
Usually the term of tenancy was carefully stated.
It was most commonly one year. The cost of repairs fell
on the tenant, according to the Code,<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> but he was forbidden
to make any alterations until he had paid over the earnest-money.
The Code perhaps only means to forbid his
closing the door and fastening it, until the deposit was
made. The landlord, in fact, preserved the right of free
entry until then.

The usual term of lease for fields was three years. It is
not possible as yet to explain why three years was stipulated,
but it was probably due to something more than an
accident of custom. Possibly a rotation of crops or an
alternation of crop and fallow may have been in vogue.

According to the Code the tenant was bound to keep the
land in good condition. His duties included the ploughing
or trenching, sowing the seed, snaring or driving off the
birds and stray beasts, weeding, watering, and harvesting.
Gardens he had to fence. The watering-machines were of
great importance and had to be kept in order. They were
worked by oxenâoften as many as eight oxen were
required to work them. A certain amount of stock was
frequently leased with the land. It is not clear that oxen
were used for the plough; they may have been kept for the
watering-machines.

In the case of the great temple landowners it seems to
have been the custom to supply a very large amount of the
tenant's necessities. Seed-corn was frequently furnished,
also corn for food for farmer and men, until the crop was
gathered. The stock and farm implements were also provided
by the landlord. This metayer system of leasing land
probably accounts for loans without interest. It is not clear
that such a system was already in vogue in early times.

There was no dwelling. The lessee was therefore called
on to erect a dwelling. Probably a simple edifice sufficed.
At the end of the tenancy the tenant was called on to resign
this building.

On account of the hire, some deposit was usually made,
which seems to bear no direct relation to amount of rent.
But while this was in many cases moneyâone to three
shekelsâa number of cases exhibit a list of quantities of
food and drink. What these were it is difficult to say, as the
terms are written ideographically. But joints of meat, pieces
of flesh, drinks, bread and oil, seem to be intended. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
custom is obscure. Possibly these are set down as weekly
or monthly rations secured on the whole rent and to be set
off against it later. That the quantities are in some sense
distributive is certain, <span class="tei tei-q">âso much each,â</span> but whether <span class="tei tei-q">âeach

stated. One plausible suggestion is that the landlord, like
the votary in the Code whose brothers do not content her,
let the farm to a man who covenanted to support or maintain
him. The contention is strengthened by the fact that
the cases known to us are all female landlords, and may
actually be examples of what the Code contemplates.
Having only a life interest in the property and being
without capital, they could not afford to wait until harvest
to receive the rent, but needed a frequent allowance for
maintenance.

The lease of an estate for a term exceeding a few years
was always rare. One is found on a tablet which is one of
the most interesting of all those supposed to be of the First
Dynasty of Babylon. The script and the language recall
Assyrian types most vividly and it is full of non-Babylonian
names, which suggest Hittite, or even Armenian, origin.
Unfortunately, it is not dated. It might well have been
found at Kalaá¸«, or Asshur, and belong to somewhat early
Assyrian times, perhaps before Assyrian independence of
Babylonia. Not one person named in it occurs in the other
tablets of the Bu. 91-5-9 Collectionâa thing which cannot
be said of another of them. If this was really found with
them, we can only suppose that centralization was carried to
such a pitch that important legal documents, even when executed
as far away as Assyria, or Mesopotamia proper, had
to be sent in duplicate to the capital of Babylonia. Or was
it possible that the principal party came to the capital with
this document in his possession, deposited it in the temple
archives there, and died, leaving no one to reclaim it.

The names of the witnesses are here given in full because
of their exceptional interest. Until we are sure of his
nationality it is scarcely safe to suppose the principal's
name was really pronounced Ishtar-kitillaâthe latter part of
the name may well be an ideogram. The name of his
father ending also in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">TIL-LA</span></span> suggests that that group of
signs is separable. If so, the signs read Ishtar-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">KI</span></span> may
perhaps be ideographic also. It is evident that Teá¸«ip is
from the same root as Itá¸«ip, and the form looks Semitic.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
KibÃ®a, PalÃ®a, Urá¸«Ã®a are Semitic, but Irishenni and Taishenni
remind one of the Erisinni, of the son of U'alli, King
of the Mannai in AshurbÃ¢nipal's time. Still, neither can be
said to be non-Semitic with certainty, when we recall the

the name of the god Teshup were known long ago,
as á¸¤u-Teshup, Kali-Teshup, Kili-Teshup, where the other
element of the name does not seem to be Semitic. Egyptian
records give us other compounds of the name of this

Of the other names, Shellu, Kushshu, á¸¤uluá¸³á¸³u, and Zinu
seem to be Semitic; at any rate they occur frequently, or
in cognate forms, well known among the Assyrians and
Babylonians. The others are all very unfamiliar. We are
as yet so imperfectly acquainted with the onomastics of the
nations surrounding the Semites that it is hazardous to
attempt to locate these people. Supposing them to be all
of one race, they may belong to a colony settled near
Sippara, but the whole style of the language is so unlike
the Sippara documents that we can hardly suppose that to
be the case.

The oldest form of business in Asiatic life is
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">commenda</span></span>:
the commendatist gives a fixed sum of money to the agent
with which he does his business. The former takes a fixed
share of the profit, say half, in addition to the original sum
invested. The agent usually secures guarantees for the
capital. This method of carrying on business is customary
in the early times. The Code regulates the relations between
principal and agent. The former is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tamkaru</span></span>,
usually rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âmerchant,â</span> and the latter is
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡amallÃ»</span></span>, often
rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âapprentice.â</span> The merchant is, however, a trader
in many ways, and in the Code he is usually named, where
we expect lender or creditor. Hence there is little doubt
that his name is derived from <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">magÃ¢ru</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">makÃ¢ru</span></span>, with a
meaning <span class="tei tei-q">âto trafficâ</span> (?). He seems to have been a monied
man, who was ready to make to cultivators advances on
their cropsâa practice always liable to great abuses, which
the Code aims to check.

The merchant principal also furnished goods, among which
are mentioned corn, sesame, oil, wool, wine, and manufactured
articles. The agent did the trading, and regularly
rendered his accounts to his principal. He travelled from
place to place to find a market for his goods, or to make
purchases, which could be profitably sold at home. The
principal paid no salary, but received again his capital, or
the value of his goods, and an interest or share of the profit.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is clear that the merchant also moved from place to place,
and there is evidence that many of them were foreigners.
The travelling agents with their goods formed the caravan.

Unfortunately, the opening sections of the part dealing with the
relations of principal and agent are lost; but from what is
left we see that it insisted on exact accounts being taken,
on both sides, of the amounts of money or value of goods
thus invested. If the merchant intrusted money to his
agent, he was to take a receipt for it. If the agent received
goods, he was to enter their money value and obtain his
principal's acknowledgment of the amount of his debt. If
he suffered loss of goods from his caravan by bandits, or in
an enemy's land, he could swear to his loss, and be exempt
from repayment to his principal. But if he did not prosper
in his business, or sold at a loss, he had to make good the
capital, at least, to his principal. The Code leaves nothing
to chance. If the agent is foolish enough not to obtain a
sealed memorandum of the amounts received, or a receipt
for what he pays to his principal, it is enacted that money
not sealed for cannot be put in the accounts. Much was
clearly left to the good faith of the agent. The principal
was tolerably secure of receiving back his money and had
hope of profit. Against that he had to set possible loss by
robbery of the caravan. But he was not bound again to
employ the same agent. An agent detected defrauding his
principal had to pay threefold. But it speaks well for the
Code as protector of the weak that it made the capitalist
who defrauded the agent repay sixfold.

Association, or partnership, makes its appearance very
early and in a highly developed state. Some forms are
very simple, as when two or more men buy or hire a piece
of land together. There may, or may not, be any family
relationship between the partners. In some cases we learn
nothing about the terms of partnership. But where we are
able to discern them, they follow the natural course that
profits were divided, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro rata,</span></span> according to the capital
contributed. More obscure is the question how far the personal
exertions of each partner were pledged to the benefit
of the firm. There is a suggestion that some partners were
content with furnishing capital, and obtaining a fair return
upon it, while the others were actively engaged in the business
of the firm. Prolonged study and comparison are, however,
needed before all these points can be definitely decided.

The name for a <span class="tei tei-q">âpartnerâ</span> is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tappÃ»</span></span>,
and the sign <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">TAP</span></span>
serves as ideogram. This sign consists of the two horizontal
strokes used to denote <span class="tei tei-q">âtwo,â</span> and may have been used
to denote <span class="tei tei-q">âunion,â</span> or partnership, and so from its name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tap</span></span>
have given rise to the name for <span class="tei tei-q">âpartner.â</span> In the new
Babylonian times the ideogram is the sign usually read
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸«arrÃ¢nu</span></span>, also formed of the two horizontal strokes
crossed by two connecting strokes or bonds. There is little doubt
that in early times this was read <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">girru</span></span>, when denoting
<span class="tei tei-q">âbusiness,â</span> undertaken in association. Later the dualism
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the partnership was marked by the addition of the dual

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸«arrÃ¢nu</span></span> and

to the prominence of the idea of trade journeys with caravans.
But partnerships were made with less ambitious
aims and confined to holding and sharing in common varied
sources of income.

Yearly accounts were rendered and the profit then
shared. This took place by a formal dissolution of partnership,
when each partner took his share. This in no way
prevented a renewal of partnership. For the satisfaction
of the partners sworn declarations as to the property held
in common and the profit made were deposed before judicial
authorities. These often take the form of a suit by one
partner against the other, but it seems that they might be
only formal suits to clear up the points at issue and secure
a legal settlement.

The word for plan, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¹­Ãªmu</span></span>, means the basis of partnership,
that is, its terms. Here it was <span class="tei tei-q">âshare and share alike.â</span>
The phrase <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">babtum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âmerchandise,â</span> includes all the
material in which they traded, excluding the living agents. The
phrase <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a á¸«arrÃ¢nim</span></span>, literally <span class="tei tei-q">âon the road,â</span> may
well have denoted the merchandise not in warehouse, but in circulation.
Whether <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸«arrÃ¢nu</span></span> actually referred to a caravan may
be doubtful. We often read of goods <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a suá¸³i</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âon the
street,â</span> in the same sense, <span class="tei tei-q">âout on the market.â</span> If the

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a á¸«arrÃ¢nim</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a suá¸³i</span></span>
was kept up is not clear. But if they invested their capital in merchandise which they
sent to a distant market for sale, the former phrase would be
more appropriate, while if they bought wool to manufacture
into cloth or garments and to sell in the bazaars of
their own town, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a suá¸³i</span></span> would be more suitable. The gate
of the city was a market, and money or goods <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a bÃ¢bi</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">âat the gate,â</span> was as we should say <span class="tei tei-q">âon the market.â</span> In contrast
to these phrases, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ina libbi alim</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âin the midst of the
town,â</span> answers to our <span class="tei tei-q">âin stock.â</span> While the term
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mitá¸«ariÅ¡</span></span> literally means <span class="tei tei-q">âaltogether,â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âwithout

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">amÃ¢tu</span></span> was the <span class="tei tei-q">âword,â</span>
literally, but, applied to business, means the agreement as
to their mutual transactions. The completion of that was
reached when they took the profits and divided them. It
might include the mutual reckoning of profit and loss. The
phrase <span class="tei tei-q">âfrom mouth to interestâ</span> is very idiomatic. The

In later Babylonian times the phrase survived. The
commissary acted <span class="tei tei-q">âwith the handâ</span> of his principal. We
may take this to be the hand-sign, or seal, representing
written authority. It involved a reckoning with his master,
and naturally gave rise to a number of delicate questions.
If a man bought a house for another, having been commissioned
so to do, his principal must of course pay the
price. But was he bound to accept his agent's selection?
Could he not demur regarding the price? One of these
points at least was dealt with by the later Code. Law A
deals with the man who has concluded a purchase for
another, without having a power of attorney from him in a
sealed deed. If he has had the deed made out in his own
name, he is the possessor. Of course, he can sell again to
his principal, but he could not do so at a profit. Nor is the
principal under any obligation to accept the purchase at the
price the agent gave for it. Actual examples are far from
rare: A buys a field, crop, date-palms and all, for C and D.
This purchase was made on condition that all copies of the
transaction be destroyed. The condition was not observed,
as we still possess one of them. Later A received from C,
one of his principals, about half the price he had paid. But
it does not appear that D ever paid his share, and this is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The temples and large landowners had great flocks and
herds. Consequently, there is much evidence concerning
the pastoral occupations of the people of Babylonia. The
Code regulates the relations of the shepherds and herdsmen
to the flock-masters.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a>
Thus an owner might hire a shepherd, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nÃ¢kidu</span></span>,
for his sheep or cattle, at the wages of eight
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">GUR</span></span> of corn <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per
annum</span></span>. The shepherd or herdsman took
out the flock or herd to the pasture and was responsible to
the owner for them. They were intrusted to him, and if
sheep or ox were lost through his fault, he had to restore ox
for ox and sheep for sheep. If he was hired and had received
satisfactory wages, he had no power to diminish, or
abstract from, the flock or herd for his keep or private use.
He entered into a contract with the owner, and that stipulated
for the restoration of the entire flock or herd, together
with a proper increase due to the breeding of the flock or
herd. He had to make any deficiency good, by statute.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href="#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a>
This applied also to the stipulated profit in wool or other
produce. It seems clear that his own profit was any excess
above the stipulated return. Otherwise it is difficult to see
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what source he had from which to make good the loss to
his master. He was forbidden to alter the agreement into
which he had entered in any particular, or to sell any of the
flock, under penalty of a tenfold restitution. He was, however,
protected from liability for loss by wild beasts or accident.
But, if the loss was due to his fault, by neglecting to
keep the fold secure, he had to make up the loss.

It is obvious that he gave a receipt for what was intrusted
to him and made his account on return from the
pastures. These accounts are plentiful among the temple

As a rule, each deals with the liabilities of one man, whose
<span class="tei tei-q">âaccount,â</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nikasu</span></span>, it is said to be. At the
beginning are recounted the details of his trust, so many oxen, cows, sheep
or goats, of varied ages and qualities. Here it is very difficult
to translate. Anyone who knows the variety of names
which are given to an animal by agriculturists according to
its age, sex, and use, need not be surprised to find that the
Babylonians had many names for what we can only render
by <span class="tei tei-q">âsheep.â</span> As a rule, we know when the ram, ewe, or
lamb is intended. But this by no means exhausts the variety.
Anyone who glances through an Arabic lexicon must
notice how many different names the Arabs have for the
camel in its different aspects. But in our case we often
have no clew to what was meant by the signs beyond some
variety of sheep, ox, or goat. At any rate, the first section
enumerates the cattle or sheep delivered to the herdsman.
Then follows a section devoted to those <span class="tei tei-q">âwithdrawn,â</span> taken
back by the owner, or exacted as some due from the flock.
Others are noted as taken for sacrifice, used for the wages
or support of the herdsman, or else dead or otherwise missing.
These the herdsman was allowed to subtract and then
had to return the balance. There are similar lists of asses
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or goats. The tablets hardly lend themselves to connected
translation because of the absence of verbs. The following
is an example:

Wool accounts play an important part in documents of
the early times. They may be regarded as of two kinds.
The first are shearers' accounts returned by the shepherd of
a flock; the second are concerned with the amounts of wool
given out to weavers.

Shearers' accounts enumerate four sorts or qualities of
wool. The best was called royal wool, that which was of
the highest quality. The others were second, third, and
fourth quality. Poor wool and black wool are also named.
Sometimes we are told from what part of the sheep's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body it was taken. Other terms applied are less easy to

The weavers' accounts give a list of quantities of wool,
with the same distinctions as to quality, and the price at
which it was assessed. This was doubtless the sum to be
paid by the weaver, if the wool was not returned made up.
The values attached show very clearly the difference in
quality. Thus, while two looms of royal wool were worth
thirty minas, seven looms of second quality went for the
same value, eleven looms of third quality for a talent, and
thirty-two looms of fourth quality for one talent, one loom
of another sort for one talent, and the same amount of
black wool for the same value.<a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href="#note_784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> It is evident that the
black wool was highly valued. The loom, literally, <span class="tei tei-q">âbeam,â</span>
of wool, was some measure, perhaps what would occupy
one weaver. The price was probably fixed in silver. The
price of the same quality varied from time to time.

more the way in which they have since been preserved,
renders it impossible for us to make the use of them which
has often been made of mediÃ¦val accounts. Otherwise we
could obtain from them many interesting items. They are,
however, most valuable for prices and names.

It is well known that there is no certainty as to the order

at least forty years later. Any contribution to the order of

The ancient Babylonians early discovered the convenience
of written communication between friends at a distance.
The origin of letter-writing is not yet clear; for,
when we first meet with letters, they are fully developed.
A piece of clay, usually shaped like a miniature pillow,
was inscribed and then enclosed in an envelope made
of a thin sheet of clay. On the envelope was written the
address. As a rule, the letter was baked hard before being
put into its envelope. Powdered clay was inserted to prevent
sticking. The envelope, after being inscribed, was also
baked hard. Of course, the letter could not be read without
breaking the envelope, which was therefore a great protection
to the interior letter. The envelope was naturally
thrown away after being broken. Hence, extremely few
envelopes have been preserved.

The practice of dating letters does not seem to have been
common. We have dated letters at all epochs, but they are
few. In some cases the date may have been on the envelope.
It is more common for the writer to give the day of
the month, sometimes also the month. But the date of a
letter was probably not then of any great importance.

Some letters seem to have been covered with coarse cloth,
on which was impressed a lump of clay, to act as a seal and
bind down the edges. The lumps were then sealed with a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
signet-ring, or cylinder-seal. The clay envelopes were also
sealed, before baking, with the sender's seal. So usual was
this habit, that the word for seal, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">uná¸³u</span></span>,
is often used to denote a sealed letter. Thus when an official acknowledges
the receipt of the king's <span class="tei tei-q">âseal,â</span> it means a sealed order or
rescript.

The early Babylonian letters usually open with the formula,
<span class="tei tei-q">âTo A say: Thus saith B.â</span> The formula probably goes
back to the times when the message was verbally delivered.
These would be the words used to a messenger who had to
remember the message. The verb <span class="tei tei-q">âsaithâ</span> is not expressed
exactly. The word used is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">umma</span></span>, which is often rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">âsayingâ</span>; it introduces a direct quotation. We might render,
<span class="tei tei-q">âIn the name of B.â</span> But the written letter replaced
the spoken message. Some think the letter was read by a
professional reader. Such readers are common still, where
education is not widely diffused. It is very clear that the
letter was generally written by a scribe. Thus, all á¸¤ammurabi's
letters show the same hand, while those of AbÃªshu
or Ammi-ditana are quite different. In the case of private
letters we have less proof. But it is possible that the king
sometimes wrote with his own hand. Some terms of expression
render that very likely. It is, however, quite impossible
to be certain on such points.

is nearly the same; with the omission of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸³ibi</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-q">âsay,â</span> it reads <span class="tei tei-q">âTo A thus B.â</span> In addresses to superiors,
B usually adds <span class="tei tei-q">âthy servant.â</span> Polite letters generally add
good wishes for the recipient. These are exceedingly varied.
The word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡ulmu</span></span> plays a great part in them. Literally
it denotes <span class="tei tei-q">âpeace.â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âPeace be to theeâ</span> is very common.
But it soon came to mean the <span class="tei tei-q">âgreeting of peace.â</span>

Thus <span class="tei tei-q">âI have sent <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ana Å¡ulmika</span></span>â</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">âI have
sent to wish thee peace,â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âto greet thee.â</span> But it also takes the
more general meaning of well-being. Thus <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡ulmu iÃ¢Å¡i</span></span>
means <span class="tei tei-q">âI am well,â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âit is peace with meâ</span>; not only absence
from war, but health and all prosperity was included.
Hence Joram's inquiry of Jehu, <span class="tei tei-q">âIs it peace, Jehu?â</span> means
<span class="tei tei-q">âIs everything all right?â</span> <span class="tei tei-q">âBe thou at peaceâ</span> may be
rendered loosely, <span class="tei tei-q">âI hope you are well,â</span> in the fullest sense
that <span class="tei tei-q">âall is well with you.â</span> No consistent rendering can
be given for such phrases as these.

Very often letters quote the previous message of the present
recipient, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å¡a taÅ¡puranni</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">âwhat thou didst send me.â</span>
But the quotation is often omitted and then this becomes
an awkward rendering. We have to fill up some general
sentence such as, <span class="tei tei-q">âas to what you sent about.â</span> A very difficult
sort of construction arises when the writer sets down a
list of questions, which he has been asked, and the answer
to each. As there are no capitals, periods, or question-marks,
there is often some difficulty in separating a question
from its answer. This may be done differently by different
translators, with startlingly different results.

say, <span class="tei tei-q">âAs the king sees fit.â</span> Such elliptical sentences are
often very difficult to complete. They were obviously

The Tell el Amarna tablets, some three hundred in number,
were discovered in 1887-88, at the ruins of the palace
of Amenophis IV., in Egypt. They will form the subject
of a separate volume of this series. They consist of the
letters or despatches sent to kings of Egypt by the kings of
Babylon, Assyria, Mitanni, and the subject-rulers of many
Syrian and Palestinian cities and states. From these can
be obtained a very clear view of the state of Syria and Palestine
just before the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt.
Naturally, these letters have formed the subject of a very
large literature. The most complete edition of the texts is
by Winckler, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Der Thontafelfund von el

English translation by J. P. Metcalf is to be had. There
are a few of these tablets, which found their way into private
hands, or to other museums than London, Berlin, and
Gizeh, whence Winckler's copies were obtained. It is a duty
to science that these should now be published. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bulletin
de l'Institut FranÃ§ais d'ArchÃ©ologie orientale</span></span>, t. II.,
published at Cairo, Professor Scheil gives the text of two
more of these important letters. The explorer, Dr. F. Bliss,
found another in the ruins of Lachish. It is included in
Winckler's work above. Professor Sellin has lately found
several tablets, which by their script and personal references
are shown to belong to this period. They were found
at Ta'annek, and are published by Dr. Hronzy in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anzeige der philos. hist. Klasse der Wiener

The interest of these additions lies in the fact that they
were found in Palestine itself.

The subsequent periods in Babylonia are represented by
few letters. It is not until we come down to the end of the
eighth century and the Sargonide times that we meet with
many letters. The archives of Nineveh contained immense
numbers. A great many of these are now in the Kouyunjik
Collections of the British Museum. There they early attracted
attention. Being written by the imperial officials to
the kings of Assyria, they contain most valuable material

for their interpretation. In 1892 Professor R. F. Harper

One of the uses to which the letters may be put is to illustrate
the history of the time. From the letters of á¸¤ammurabi
we can gather a great deal of information as to the
civil policy of the reign. From the Tell el Amarna tablets
we may reconstruct almost a complete survey of the condition
of politics in Palestine. From the Assyrian letters we
can rewrite the history of affairs in Armenia at the end of
Sargon's reign, or the wars with Elam in AshurbÃ¢nipal's
time.

The letters are also a rich mine of information on all sorts
of topics, and those very often on which almost all other
literatures are silent. We gain here a closer and more intimate
acquaintance with humanity than at any other period
of ancient history. We must not expect finality in our translations
for a long while to come. Fresh documents will continually
be found or published that will help us to revise
our views. But that is the perennial interest of the letters.
We may read and reread them, always finding something
fresh to combine with every new piece of information.

Several different methods of classifying the letters suggest
themselves. One plan would be to group those letters
which illustrate some phase of civil life. Thus we may collect
the references to medical cases, or the illustrations of
religious life, or the contributions to astronomy and astrology.
But none of these methods will be exhaustive or generally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
applicable. A letter rarely deals with only one subject.
The only scientific classification seems to be that
adopted by Professor Harper in his edition of the Nineveh
letters, or Mr. King in his letters of á¸¤ammurabi. This is
to place together all the letters written by one scribe. Here
we have two difficulties. There may be more than one
scribe of the same name. Thus it is practically certain that
in Professor Harper's groups of letters apparently assigned
to one man, more than one person is often really involved.
Again, a very large number of letters no longer preserve the
name of their scribe. Only a prolonged study can reduce
these difficulties; it is not likely that we shall ever quite
eliminate error.

There is one large group that has a claim to separate consideration.
Many letters are written by, or to, a king. They
are on various subjects. A subdivision might be made of
reports sent by officials concerning public affairs. But even
these often contain side-references; and at the last we have
really to consider each letter as a separate document.

The letters of á¸¤ammurabi are by far the most important
collection of letters hitherto published for the period of the
First Dynasty of Babylon. They had a certain adventitious
value at one time, because one of them was thought to contain
the name of Chedorlaomer, and this association with
á¸¤ammurabi, as Amraphel, was exploited in the interests of
a defence of the historical value of Genesis xiv. Mr. L. W.
King's edition of the letters, however, showed that such a
use was unwarranted. But it served a much more useful
end, giving us a very full picture of the times of the founder
of the First Babylonian Empire. The excellent account
given by Mr. King of the contents of these letters is fairly
exhaustive. The importance of such sources for history
cannot be overestimated. They are contemporary. They
are not written to impress posterity, but with absolute
fidelity to fact. We may disbelieve some of the excuses
made for misconduct, but in the references to current events
or general customs we have a sure witness, if only we can
understand them. This is often difficult because a letter
presupposes relations between the correspondents which we
must conjecture.

Since Mr. King's introduction to his first volume gives a
full account of the few letters previously published, this
need not be reproduced here. Of á¸¤ammurabi's letters fifty-three
are addressed to one and the same man, Sin-iddinam.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is doubtful whether he was the King of Larsa who bore
this name, or the official who in the next reign seems to be
Governor of Sippara. There are many persons who bore
this name known at this period. However, several mentions
of the temple of Shamash at Larsa occur in these letters and
there is a certain presumption that Sin-iddinam of Larsa was
the person intended.

á¸¤ammurabi's ability as an administrator, which these
letters reveal, and his care even for small details of his rule,
may well be the reason why his empire proved so stable.
He established a tradition which was long followed by his
successors. He organized his land, appointed governors,
and held them responsible to himself. He had a direct interest
in their doings and sent minute written instructions,
demanding reports, summoning defaulters to his presence,
or directing their punishment where they were. The dates
for his reign, as for others of the dynasty, show, not only
raids and conquests, but chiefly public works of utility.
The construction or repair of canals, public buildings,
temples, the ordering of justice, are works that repaid
his care.

á¸¤ammurabi was a man of many business enterprises.
The collection of the temple revenues was an object of
his attention. There is no evidence that these were available
for his use, but he had a personal interest in all that
was right and just. To him the herdsmen and shepherds
of the temple flocks and herds had to report. He often
appears as restoring, rebuilding, or adorning shrines, and he
was careful of his religious duties. Thus he postponed a case
because of a festival at Ur, which he seems to have found
demanded the presence of one of the parties.

Thus he told Sin-iddinam there was to be a
second Elul.

The administration of justice was also no small part of
his work. Not only did he promulgate a code, but he also
superintended its execution. There was a right of appeal
to his judgment. He actively supervised his judges in the
provinces. Thus a case of bribery was reported from DÃ»r-gurgurri
and he instructed Sin-iddinam to investigate the
case and send the guilty parties to Babylon for punishment.
He upheld a merchant's claim against a city governor, for
the recovery of a loan. He protected the landowners
against money-lenders. He examined claims to land and
sent instructions to Sin-iddinam to carry out his decision.
Thefts of corn, loans withheld, rents, were adjudicated by
him. He summoned not only the parties, but the witnesses,
to Babylon. Prisoners were sent under escort, and arrests
ordered.

The king's own herds and flocks were a personal care to
him. They were stationed in various parts of the country.
He received reports about them, or sent inspectors to report
upon them. On one occasion he summoned forty-seven
shepherds to come and report to him in Babylon. He ordered
additional shearers to assist those already at work.
He regulated supplies of wood, dates, seed, and corn. These
were often sent by ship, and there is evidence of a large
number of ships being employed, of varied capacities.

Public buildings demanded large gangs of workmen.
They were drawn from the slave and serf population. A
great many letters are concerned with the supply and movements
of these laborers. Whether forced labor was inflicted
as a punishment may be doubted. But the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">corvÃ©e</span></span> was in
full operation. The hire of laborers is referred to, and it is
probable that the forced laborers were fed and clothed at

the expense of the state. Thus we see that á¸¤ammurabi
was a busy man and worked hard to build up his empire.
His successors, though we have fewer of their letters, seem
to have been fully as active.

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The transport of the goddesses was made possible by the
system of canals. Intercommunication was in an excellent
state, for á¸¤ammurabi ordered a man to be sent to Babylon
from Larsa, and allowed him two days, travelling day and
night. The hierodules are the female attendants of the goddesses.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The officers whom á¸¤ammurabi sent bear titles not
yet clearly recognized. The name á¸¤ammurabi-banÃ® points
to a deification of the king. Whether the goddesses reached
Babylon and there brought misfortune on the country and
so were sent back again, or whether their restoration to their
shrines in Emutbal was part of the king's policy for a pacification
of the conquered country, does not appear. But we read in another
letter:<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a>

The construction of the passage seems to imply that the
goddesses had protected Inuá¸«-samar. The latter was in
command of troops that were within Sin-iddinam's jurisdiction;
for when Sin-mÃ¢gir complained to á¸¤ammurabi that
Inuá¸«-samar had impressed some of his servants for military
service contrary to a bond given him by the king,
á¸¤ammurabi referred the matter to Sin-iddinam, ordering
the servant to be given up.<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> It was this name Inuá¸«-samar

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is clear that Lalu was one of those privileged officials
who held lands by royal charter, and who could not be dispossessed
of their land. The Code directs<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> that a governor

under pain of death. Although a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kadurru</span></span> is not there

It is interesting to notice where the record was to
be found. The palace, or <span class="tei tei-q">âgreat house,â</span> was the residence
of the governor. The tablet probably recorded the appointment
of Lalu to his benefice; it therefore was his title-deed.
An interesting question may be raised here. Did á¸¤ammurabi
mean in his own palace? It may be so, for he writes
in another letter:<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href="#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a>

Now how could á¸¤ammurabi know this unless the tablet

The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Å akkanak</span></span> was usually the superior official,
<span class="tei tei-q">âgovernor,â</span> of a city, or of a ward of a city. We are not
told what was Sin-mÃ¢gir's district. But it was under Sin-iddinam's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The case is not quite clear, but Ibni-Martu owed a tax
on his field. He had either mortgaged or let his field to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
another. This tenant had not given him the corn to pay
the tax and excused himself on the ground that the produce
of the field was now mixed up with that of another
field. Hence he could not say how much the tax should
be; clearly it was proportionate to the yield. The method
of solving the difficulty was that a sworn estimate had to
be taken from competent witnesses and the tax levied on
that basis. This course was recommended by Sin-iddinam
in a previous report on the situation. The amount was to
be given to the landlord, who then had to pay the tax. He
clearly had no rent in corn from the land; but he could not
sell or mortgage his crop except subject to the tax. The
mortgagee was liable for the tax and the owner was bound
to pay. The mortgagee must furnish him the means to
do so; he had no right to claim the part of the crop due as
tax, whatever bargain he had made with the owner of the
land.

While agriculture was in the hands of free men who
only paid on produce, there are indications that commerce
was very strictly controlled by the State. The merchant
was the only money-lender as a rule. He also seems to
have acted as contractor, or farmer of taxes. The merchant,
or factor, was under the king's protection and also directly
responsible to him. Hence some have regarded him as a
royal official. But this is hardly correct. He was to á¸¤ammurabi
what the Jew of the Middle Ages was to the king
then, or the Stock Exchange or Bourse is now. Probably
we should not be far wrong in applying to him the term
<span class="tei tei-q">âpublican,â</span> in the New Testament sense. He owed a certain
amount to the treasury, which he recouped from the
taxes due from the district for which he contracted. If he
did not secure enough, he had to make up the deficit. The

keep accounts. Hence the term <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aklu</span></span>, properly a

not till á¸¤ammurabi that the title <span class="tei tei-q">âkingâ</span> was generally

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are many obscurities about this letter. Some are
caused by the difficulty of reading the defaced characters.
Some by the fact that the signs, printed here in capitals, are
ideograms whose meaning is not yet clear. The prisoner, if
his plea is true, was sent on an errand for his master, apparently
to trade for him. He was either robbed by the nomad
SutÃ», or compelled to give up his oil to them. Why this
led to imprisonment is not clear, unless it was regarded as
furnishing supplies to the enemy. But though his master
did not get him out of prison, it seems that he had sent him
supplies from time to time. The word rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âjailerâ</span> is
perhaps a name, MÃ¢r-abulli, <span class="tei tei-q">âson of the gate.â</span> But it may
be a title used as a name, <span class="tei tei-q">âMr. Jailer.â</span> The prisoner thinks
that it is in the power of his master to put an end to his
imprisonment and promises to be grateful. But he does not
seem sure whether his master can do this. He asks, however,
for further supplies, if he is to live. Let us hope he
was released or at least fed. We may perhaps conclude
that imprisonment was the punishment due for robbery and
burglary.

and now, my father, thou hast returned to the presence of Taribu,

thou shalt not ask the purport of my note, until LashÃªr has brought
me my father's note. My father has not sent one to bring even a

Sin AmurrÃ», who hearken to my father, my ears are attentive. Let
my father send and let not my heart be vexed. Before Shamash and
Marduk, may I pray for my father.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The letter suggests that the father was king, by the
phrase so common in the historical inscriptions, <span class="tei tei-q">ânamed his
name,â</span> usually equivalent to <span class="tei tei-q">ânominatedâ</span> to rule. The
word rendered <span class="tei tei-q">âfaultâ</span> is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sardu</span></span>,
which may be for <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sartu</span></span>.
There is nothing to show whether Elmeshu is a man or
woman. There was an Elmeshu (the name means <span class="tei tei-q">âDiamondâ</span>)
who was daughter of Ammi-ditana.<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> But the mention
of DÃ»r-Ammi-zadÃ»ga seems to demand a date at least as
late as that in which this wall or city was built. But Ammi-zadÃ»ga
succeeded Ammi-ditana. Unless the latter built
DÃ»r-Ammi-zadÃ»ga and called it after his son, we can hardly
identify this Elmeshu with the daughter of Ammi-ditana.
The mention of Sin AmurrÃ» is not quite clear. We may
suppose two gods, Sin and AmurrÃ», or take the latter name
as an epithet, <span class="tei tei-q">âSin of the Amorites.â</span> To have <span class="tei tei-q">âthe ears
attentive,â</span> is to be in a state of expectation. In the last
sentence, Elmeshu seems to hint that, if she does not have
a favorable answer, she will not be able to pray for her
father. This may be regarded as an un-Christian attitude,
but people then thought more of the efficacy of prayer;
and it was a threat, if so meant, likely to have great weight
with the father. But it may mean that Elmeshu being
vowed to a religious life, yet needed material means to
maintain her alive, and she merely hopes, by her father's continued
sustenance of her, to be long spared to pray for him.

had seen what sort of a cow he was to get for his money.

better meaning for <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¹£imittu</span></span>
than <span class="tei tei-q">âyokeâ</span> was readily obtained.
As Dr. Peiser pointed out, the word is also used
in the Cappadocian tablets in a way that leaves small doubt
of its meaning. It may have come to mean simply <span class="tei tei-q">âpay,â</span>
but must have ordinarily meant <span class="tei tei-q">âmeasure,â</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">âweigh,â</span> according

mina of silver, and it was acknowledged in writing, in the presence
of my witnesses. He went to Assyria. He did not give the money

the affair. Said I, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">â</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I sent thee money by Ardi-ilishu.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">â</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> He said,

more or less, and from that take the fourteen shekels and send the
surplus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two, Erib-Sin and Ibni-NabÃ», are either partners, or
agents. The former had asked the latter to pay over fourteen
shekels to a certain Shamash-bÃªl-ilÃ¢ni, either because
the latter had money of his, or had promised to honor his
order. But this particular order was not honored. Ibni-NabÃ»
had intrusted a sum of forty shekels to one Ardi-ilishu,
with which to pay Shamaiatu. But Ardi-ilishu had
gone off to Assyria without discharging the obligation. So
Shamaiatu had demanded payment and perhaps the doubtful
signs express the fact that Ibni-NabÃ» had to pay a second
time. Fortunately, he could prove that Ardi-ilishu
had had the money, having taken a receipt. He seems to
think that Erib-Sin can find Ardi-ilishu. Was the former
resident in Assyria? If so, this must be a copy of the letter
sent him. But perhaps Erib-Sin was to arrest the defaulter
on his return to Sippara. At any rate, this was a
warrant for so doing. That, perhaps, is why the letter was
kept. If Erib-Sin could get forty shekels and the interest,
he had a fair margin from which to pay the fourteen
shekels, due to him from Ibni-NabÃ». But he had to take
risks. If Shamash-bÃªl-ilÃ¢ni had given Erib-Sin consideration
for his order on Ibni-NabÃ» for fourteen shekels, he
was badly served.

Among the Ninevite collections we can single out several
periods where the history is supplemented by the letters.
Thus Sennacherib's letters to his father, Sargon, chiefly deal
with events in Armenia, which must have transpired during
Sargon's last few years, when his annals and other
historical inscriptions are silent. This view of them was
first worked out by the present writer,<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> and later with increased
material by R. C. Thompson.<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a> Briefly put, the
argument from them is this: a person called Sennacherib,
who might be any officer from the times of Sargon onward,
writes to the king, whom he does not address as his father,
on the reports which have reached him from a number of
officials, concerning events in Armenia. We have, however,
two letters which refer to the same events, naming the same
officials and certainly from the same Sennacherib. In one
of them he is twice referred to as the king's son. The
officials named are all found in documents of the reign of
Sargon, or the early part of Sennacherib's reign. The King
of Armenia is named Argista in one of these reports to the
king, which belongs to the same group. The King of
Assyria himself is said to be at Babylon at the time. One
report quoted comes from Tabal, and is brought by the
major-domo of the Princess Aá¸«at-abisha, probably the daughter
of Sargon, who was married by him to the King of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Tabal. We have independent copies of these reports, quoted
by Sennacherib, which enlarge our knowledge of the events.
Hence, there can be no doubt that we have here Sennacherib's
letters to his father, Sargon, while that king was absent
in Babylonia. We are, therefore, able to reconstruct
a chapter of Assyrian history, on which the historical monuments
have nothing to say. The first letter reads thus:<a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href="#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a>

Kumai is named as the place where these commanders were.

<span class="tei tei-q">âthree thousand foot-soldiers, with their officers, belonging
to SÃªtini, his military commander, have set out to Muá¹£aá¹£ir,
crossed the river by night, that SÃªtini has camels with him,

started with his troops for Muá¹£aá¹£ir.â</span> It is clear from these
that the movements here refer to the beginning of the year
after that in which, in Elul, the King of Armenia was in
Uesi, and before the defeat of Armenia by the Gimirri.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A mere glance at the contents of his other letters will
show their connection with these events. In one,<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> he sends

brother, Apli-uknu, to see him there. The King of Armenia
had entered á¹¬urushpÃ®a with a number of restless men. In
another,<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href="#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> he reports the return to Assyria of a
messenger from the Ukkai, who had gone up into Armenia; and mentions
Muá¹£aá¹£ir. In a third,<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> he reports that <span class="tei tei-q">âGurÃ¢nia, Nagiu,
the fortresses of Armenia and Gimirri, are giving tribute to
Armenia.â</span> But that <span class="tei tei-q">âwhen the Armenians went to Gimirri,
they were badly defeated.â</span> The rest is so injured as to give
little sense. In another,<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a> he names AriÃª and Ariá¹£Ã¢,
DÃ»r-Shamash, Barzanishtun, the city of Ishtar-dÃ»ri, and Shulmu-bÃªl-lashme;
but the text is so defective that one cannot
discern what he had to say about them. In another,<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a> he

rebelled, that Apli-uknu, the commander of Muá¹£aá¹£ir, and
á¹¬unnaun, the commander of Kar-Sippar, went to the borders
of the Mannai, to garrison Armenia and made a slaughter

to the king that he has received a letter from Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a:
<span class="tei tei-q">âThus it is written in it, saying, a messenger of the Ukkai
went to Armenia, he has sent a letter to the palace, and
these are the contents of the letter, on the morning of the
sixth, this letter came to me; he sent, saying, the Ukkai
have heard concerning AriÃª that he went against him (the
king of Armenia) and his city.â</span> Then the letter becomes
very defective, but we hear again of Kumai and Eliá¹£ (clearly
the Eliá¹£ada above). á¹¬Ã¢b-shÃ¢r-Ashur again mentions Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a,<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href="#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a> saying that a letter of his was brought, which referred
to the King of Armenia entering some city. But too little
is preserved to make out the message. In a report<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872" href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a> about

beams of wood, collected by Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a, he is associated
with AriÃª, and Uriá¹£Ã¢, evidently the Ariá¹£Ã¢ above, and the
city Kumai. Finally, on a letter by Gabbu-ana-Ashur he is
mentioned in a most significant way. The writer says: <span class="tei tei-q">âConcerning
the news which the king gave me about the garrisons
of Armenia, from the time that I entered the city Kurban,
my messengers went to NabÃ»-li', to Ashur-bÃªl-danÃ¢n, to
Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a; they came to me.â</span> After a break he goes on,
<span class="tei tei-q">âLike this I have heard; the Armenian (king) has not gone
out of á¹¬urushpÃ®a.â</span> After some more uncertain traces, he
adds: <span class="tei tei-q">âOn the twenty-third of Tammuz I entered into Kurban,
on the twentieth of Ab I sent a letter to the king, my
lord.â</span> It is evident that NabÃ»-li', Ashur-bÃªl-danÃ¢n, and
Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a were the commanders most concerned in these
events. NabÃ»-li', we have already seen, sent reports to Sennacherib;
no letters of Ashur-bÃªl-danÃ¢n, yet published, seem
to refer to these events. But clearly the king was concerned
to hear from other quarters than Kalaá¸«, where Sennacherib
evidently was. Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a is also named elsewhere
on fragments not yet published.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole tone of the letter and the fact that Ashur-riá¹£Ã»a
above acknowledges having received an order to send
scouts make us think he is the unknown writer. But, of
course, the king may have sent the order to other commanders
as well. In an unpublished text we read that the
commander of Uesi was slain.

The references to á¹¬urushpÃ®a are also significant. We
know that this city was once the stronghold of Sardaurri,
King of Armenia, and was doubtless still attached to its
old rulers. We have a letter written by Upaá¸«á¸«ir-BÃªl,
doubtless the Eponym of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 706, and governor of Amedi.

Another period on which the letters throw considerable
light is the close of the reign of Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n in
Babylon. This was coeval with the suppression of a great
combined rebellion against the rule of Assyria. From the
historical texts of AshurbÃ¢nipal's reign we know the names
of many of the actors in that great struggle. They are
frequently referred to in the letters. Already G. Smith, in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History of Assurbanipal</span></span>, 1871, had used the information
given by some of the letters. This was utilized by
C. P. Tiele in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylonisch-assyrische Geschichte</span></span>.

But much more may be made out when the letters are
fully available. Thus NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te, grandson of Merodach
Baladan II., had been made King of the Sealands on
the death of his uncle, NÃ¢'id-Marduk. When the revolt
broke out, AshurbÃ¢nipal sent Assyrian troops to help NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te
to repel Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n. During the long
process of suppressing the revolt, it is clear that NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te
conceived the idea of reasserting the independence
of the Sealands. He endeavored to gain the
alliance of the Assyrian garrison, some he imprisoned, others
may have joined him. On the fall of Babylon, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
648, he saw that AshurbÃ¢nipal's vengeance must overtake
him, so he fled to Elam. He took with him a certain number
of Assyrians, evidently to hold as hostages. AshurbÃ¢nipal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had a long score to settle with Elam. He began
by demanding of Indabigash the surrender of NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te
and the Assyrians with him. But before the
ambassador could deliver the message, Indabigash had
been succeeded by Ummanaldash. NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te was
evidently a difficult person to lay hands upon. At any rate,
Ummanaldash's land was invaded and devastated. But
when the Assyrian troops were gone, he again returned to
his capital, Madaktu, and NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te joined him
there. Again AshurbÃ¢nipal sent to demand his surrender.
Rather than further embarrass his host, and quite hopeless
of protection or pardon, NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te ordered
his armor-bearer to slay him. Ummanaldash attempted to
conciliate AshurbÃ¢nipal by sending the body of the dead
man and the head of the armor-bearer to him. Such is
the story as AshurbÃ¢nipal tells it in his great cylinder
inscription.

The letters make no less than fifty distinct references to
him. The officers write many bad things of NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te,
and it is plain that he had been a very vicious enemy.
We have a number of letters from a writer of his name,
who may well be the King of the Sealands before he broke
with Assyria. Thus we read:<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then come a number of defective lines, from which not
much can be made out. But there can be little doubt that
this letter was written in the days when policy still kept
him faithful to Assyria. There was another NabÃ»-bÃªl-shumÃ¢te,
whose letters<a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href="#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> begin quite differently, and refer to
horses and troops. There is even a third, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">á¸³Ãªpu</span></span> of
Birati, named by TÃ¢b-á¹£il-esharra,<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> who was concerned in

It is just possible that the second and third are the same man.
But while we must exercise care in assigning the references
of the letters, we have a guide in the historical connection.

The incident here referred to, the reception of the fugitive
ShumÃ¢, who probably on account of his illness was unable
to join his uncle Tammaritu, is very similar to that related
of Tammaritu himself. This King of Elam succeeded his
cousin Ummanigash, whom he dethroned, but after a short
reign was himself dethroned by the usurper Indabigash.
He and his brothers and family and eighty-five princes
of Elam, his supporters, fled by sea from Elam to the
marshes at the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates. There
he fell sick. But AshurbÃ¢nipal sent him a friendly message,
and he came before the Assyrian governor, and kissed
the ground in token of submission. We learn that Marduk-shar-uá¹£ur
was the officer who received him, and a very mutilated
letter seems to refer to it. He was probably the
Rabshakeh to whom BÃªl-ibnÃ® wrote<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> complaining of certain
slanders about him. So even the faithful servant was not
entirely free from court intrigues. In another letter BÃªl-ibnÃ®
refers to his having received and sent on to the king,
Tammaritu, his brothers, family, and nobles.<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href="#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a>

Like Ummanigash and Indabigash, Tammaritu corresponded
with AshurbÃ¢nipal. We have letters from him to
the King of Assyria and from AshurbÃ¢nipal to him. Unfortunately
these letters are very imperfect, or not yet published.
He is mentioned continually in the letters. There
were several of the name: (1) son of Urtaku, third brother
of Teumman, (2) son of Teumman, slain with his father,
(3) son of Ummanigash, King of Elam, succeeded his cousin
Ummanigash, whom he dethroned, (4) son of Attamitu.
To which of these a reference is made is often hard to decide.

Another group refers to the events at Ur, in the far
south of Babylonia. Sin-tabni-uá¹£ur, son of Ningal-iddina,
was governor there during the time of Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n's
great rebellion. This we learn from some of the forecast
tablets, published in George Smith's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assurbanipal</span></span>.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a> The
greater part of these tablets is unintelligible, containing a
record of the omens observed, probably on inspection of the
entrails of the slaughtered sacrifices. What these symptoms
were cannot yet be determined. Much has been done by
Boissier in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Textes Assyriens relatifs au PrÃ©sage</span></span>, and
many articles contributed to various journals. The omens
are generally such as also occur in the tablets published
by Dr. Knudtzon in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gebete on den Sonnengott</span></span>, and
ably discussed by him there. The tablet evidently was
meant to submit these omens to some oracle that a prediction
might be given on their authority. The king also usually
stated his cause of anxiety and asked for guidance and
direction. These forecast tablets, many of which are dated,
are of the greatest service for the chronology of the period.
They have been partly discussed by the present writer.<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href="#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a>
Thus the two, which refer to Sin-tabni-uá¹£ur, announce that
he is governor of Ur, and seem to inquire whether he can
be relied upon to prove faithful. We may conclude that his
appointment took place in Ab, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 648.

The good Kudur sent five or six hundred archers and joined
AplÃ®a, the governor of Arrapá¸«a, and NÃ»rÃªa, governor of

of the revolt, among them NabÃ»-zÃªr-iddin. But someone

It is clear that Sin-shar-uá¹£ur and Ummanigash had been
intriguing against Sin-tabni-uá¹£ur. There are several persons
of the name Sin-shar-uá¹£ur about this time. No less than
three Eponyms bear the name after <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
648. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aba mÃ¢ti</span></span>, or
governor of Hindana, or the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ará¸³Ã»</span></span> might be meant here. But
there was a brother of Sin-tabni-uá¹£ur, of this name, who perhaps
coveted his post. Among the many unpublished texts
which refer to him one may, perhaps, be found to explain
the hostility. Nor is it clear which Ummanigash is meant.
There was one of the three sons of Urtaku, who took refuge
at the court of AshurbÃ¢nipal, when their father was murdered
and dethroned by his brother, Teumman. When the
Assyrian king espoused his cause, he was enabled by Assyrian
troops to defeat and slay the usurper Teumman and
take the throne of Elam. But he was faithless and allied
himself with Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n. He was dethroned by
his cousin, Tammaritu, shortly before the fall of Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n.
That he, while at the Assyrian Court, should
have slandered the governor of Ur, is quite in accordance
with his character, but what was his purpose, or what he
alleged, we do not know. There was another Ummanigash,
brother of Urtaku; another, son of Umbadara; another, a
son of Amedirra. The latter raised a rebellion against Ummanaldash,
as we learn from a report by BÃªl-ibnÃ®.<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a> After

It seems that the men of Pekod (see Jer. i. 21, Ez. xxiii.
23) had made an attack upon BÃ®t-Amuá¸³Ã¢ni and nearly destroyed
the country. Kudur moved into the country, but
sent for explicit orders as to what he should do. He
changes his subject rather abruptly at times and it is not
quite clear always of whom he is speaking. The most obscure
sentence is where he says that <span class="tei tei-q">âwe abhor the alienation
of territory,â</span> literally <span class="tei tei-q">âthe sin of the land.â</span> It seems

In Elam, during the reign of AshurbÃ¢nipal, there was
a protracted series of revolutions, interspersed with invasions
of, or by, Assyria. The result was the utter decay of
Elamite power, and after AshurbÃ¢nipal's final reduction of
the country and sack of Susa, the land was an easy prey to
the Aryan invaders. From the story, as told by AshurbÃ¢nipal,
the Elamites richly deserved their fate, and lest we
should suspect him of undue partiality, the matter-of-fact
letters of his officers give us substantial grounds for crediting
his view. It seems that Urtaku, who came to the
throne of Elam in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 675, was always on good terms with
Assyria. We have a letter from Esarhaddon to him<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a>

Elamites to take refuge in his land, and afterwards restored
them to their country. He also sent grain into Elam itself.
But, perhaps as consequence of having spied out the land,
the Elamites contrived to make Urtaku attack Assyria. He
was incited to this act by BÃªl-iá¸³isha, prince of the GambÃ»lai,
who inhabited the marshes about the mouth of the
UknÃ», or Blue River, perhaps the modern Karoon, bordering
on Elam. BÃªl-iá¸³isha rebelled against Assyria, and with his
troops joined Elam. NabÃ»-shum-Ãªresh, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">TIK-EN-NA</span></span>, apparently
sheik of the district of Dupliash, another Assyrian
subject, seems to have done the same. Marduk-shum-ibnÃ®,
the general of Urtaku, who led the invasion, was evidently
not an Elamite, but perhaps a Chaldean, or renegade
Babylonian. At any rate, the Elamites invaded Akkad
and covered the land like grasshoppers. They laid siege to
Babylon. On the approach of the Assyrian army, the invaders
fled. Urtaku died. BÃªl-iá¸³isha was killed by a wild
boar. NabÃ»-shum-Ãªresh was smitten with dropsy and died.
<span class="tei tei-q">âIn one year the gods cut them off.â</span> The throne of Elam
fell to Teumman, a brother of Urtaku, who maintained a
hostile attitude. DunÃ¢nu, son and successor of BÃªl-iá¸³isha,
joined Teumman. AshurbÃ¢nipal accordingly invaded Elam,
defeated and slew Teumman, ravaged the land of GambulÃ»
and captured DunÃ¢nu, who was taken to Nineveh and made
to march in the triumphal procession, with the head of
Teumman slung about his neck, and was finally tortured to
death.

All the time that Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n was king in Babylon,
AshurbÃ¢nipal seems to have retained the rule over
Southern Babylonia. At any rate, the governors of the

above-mentioned revolt in GambulÃ» was a direct concern
of the governor of Erech, who seems to have suffered
severely. As late as the twentieth year of AshurbÃ¢nipal,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

carried captive to Nineveh, along with DunÃ¢nu, and there
made to desecrate the bones of their father. But it seems

A very interesting group may be made up of letters concerned
with omens and predictions. The Assyrian kings
were firm believers in omens. They did not venture upon
any great undertaking without consulting the augurs. We
have numerous letters telling the king what days were
propitious for certain projects which he had formed. For
the most part, the whole point is obscure to us. We know
neither the purpose he had, the omens relied on, nor the real
grounds of the decision. Very often translation is impossible.
In some cases the publication of the innumerable
omen texts may give some light on the subject, but
usually it is quite impossible to see how these were made
to apply to the actual case. It is very like the case of
Nebuchadrezzar's dream. We are without any data to

SherÃ»a-eá¹­irat (a princess), Ashur-mukin-palÃªa, Sharru-shame-erá¹£iti-balÃ¢á¹­su-(iá¸³bi).
He is often named in the letters,
usually as king's son. But despite his delicate health
he survived to be made high-priest of Sin at á¸¤arrÃ¢n, by
his royal brother, and even as late as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 648 his name occurs

Balasi is a frequent writer of astrological reports, some
five and twenty being preserved, besides some fifteen letters.
In the latter he is associated with NabÃ»-aá¸«Ãª-erba no less
than seven times, once with Ishtar-shum-Ãªresh also. In
these cases we probably have the same person. But the
name occurs often in the contracts, and there belongs to at
least three different men. NabÃ»-aá¸«Ãª-erba was the writer of

The great group of writers with whom he is associated
is responsible for a large number of letters. Adadi-shum-uá¹£ur
wrote some thirty-five letters and five or six astrological
reports. He is especially prolix in his introduction.

saying, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">â</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Bring your sons, let them stand before me.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">â</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> Ardi-Gula,

servant. Among all those people, I hope none of my slanderers may

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Judging from the frequent mention of Ardi-Gula in
other letters and that he wrote to the king about his sons,
AshurbÃ¢nipal and Shamash-shum-ukÃ®n, we may be sure the
old courtier got his request, and that he was writing
to Esarhaddon. The letters of Adadi-shum-uá¹£ur concern
domestic affairs, the sickness of one, an auspicious day, the
health of another, rarely does he mention any news of
public interest. The persons about whom he writes are
the members of the royal family, Esarhaddon's children
and the above-named circle of officials. The king sent him
to see certain sick folk,<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a>
he writes about an eclipse, or a
ring, or something of the sort. He usually gives a very
long introduction; often the real message occupies only a
few lines.

Marduk-shÃ¢kin-shum is another of the same group, with
twenty-five letters. They are of the same domestic nature
as the last. Ishtar-shum-Ãªresh is the writer of a score of
letters and about thirty astrological reports. He was
evidently a younger member of the group, son of NabÃ»-zÃªr-lÃ®shir,
and chief scribe to AshurbÃ¢nipal. In the reign

In this period the calendar was very carefully regulated by
astronomical observations. As a new month began on the

month would often exceed twenty-nine days, but that a
new moon might sometimes be seen on the twenty-ninth.

But probably few ladies ever obtained a higher degree of

there seem to have been more than one city of the name.

the handmaid of the queen-mother, for some reason, will
not perform the sacrifice. The queen-mother is asked to
send authority for someone to open the treasury and perform

the clauses in the Code.<a id="noteref_932" name="noteref_932" href="#note_932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a>
There are also a great number of
tablets dealing with medicine, some of which have been
published. Long ago Professor Sayce discussed one such
text under the title, <span class="tei tei-q">âAn Ancient Babylonian Work on
Medicine,â</span><a id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933" href="#note_933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> and from the British Museum
Catalogue fully four hundred and fifty such texts are known. Dr. C. F. H.
KÃ¼chler in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">BeitrÃ¤ge zur Kenntniss der Assyrischen
Medicin</span></span> has made great progress toward settling the reading
and meaning of certain words and phrases. Dr. Baron
Felix von Oefele, who has devoted much study to ancient
medicine in general, has made noteworthy contributions to
the study, by his articles in learned journals. Still, the

great obstacle is that so much of the materia medica, which
was a very full one, is unknown; and the diseases appear
under names which do not assist us in determining the
meaning. The medical treatises considered affections of all
parts of the body, and made much of symptoms. They
prescribe roots and oils and a great variety of powdered
drugs. Some of the treatment is evidently based on extended
trial and observation. But also much reliance was
placed on charms, and diseases were associated with demons.
To drive away the demon, as well as cure the pain, was the
doctor's duty. There was full recognition of the mental
factor in sickness.

With considerable hesitation the following two letters
from the physician Ardi-NanÃ¢ to the king Esarhaddon are
given, in which Dr. C. Johnston's rendering is closely followed.
In the first, Ardi-NanÃ¢ reports on the state of a
patient, perhaps one of the young princes, who was suffering
from a disease of the eyes, or perhaps facial erysipelas. He
was progressing so well that the physician piously opines
that some god has taken the case under his care. The gods
who were special patrons of the healing art were Ninip
and Gula, whose blessing the physician accordingly invokes.

To the king, my lord, thy servant Ardi-NanÃ¢. May it be peace
in the highest degree to the king, my lord; may Ninip and Gula
give cheer of heart and health of body to the king, my lord. It is
extremely well with that poor man whose eyes are diseased. I had
applied a dressing to him, it covered his face. Yesterday, at evening,
I undid the bandage which held it, I removed the dressing
which was upon him. There was pus upon the dressing as much as
the tip of the little finger. Thy gods, if any of them has put his
hand to the matter, he has indeed given his order. It is extremely
well. Let the heart of the king, my lord, be cheered. In seven or
eight days he will be well.

The messenger here was a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">RAB MU-GI</span></span>, in which title it

knowledge himself. In another letter,<a id="noteref_936" name="noteref_936" href="#note_936"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">936</span></span></a> Ardi-NanÃ¢ writes
concerning Ashur-mukÃ®n-palÃªa, a younger son of Esarhaddon
and brother of AshurbÃ¢nipal. He bids the king
not to fear. The young prince seems to have been in the
doctor's care. Further he writes about the health of a tooth
(of the prince's?) about which the king had sent to inquire.
He had greatly improved its condition (literally, uplifted its
head). In another letter,<a id="noteref_937" name="noteref_937" href="#note_937"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">937</span></span></a> also partly defective, he

It is clear that succession was not purely hereditary.
Even when the son was alive, he might be passed over in
favor of a cousin, or for a still more distant relation. There
are many other interesting cases where the king inquires
for the proper persons to be placed in the offices vacated
through death or deposition. For example, when Esarhaddon
began to set in order the temple services, he heard
the following report:<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href="#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a>

In the long desuetude of the customary rights of Ashur, regarding

among the magnates have not complied, have not given, be it much

my lord. Now these are the magnates who have not given their dues:
the governors of Bará¸«alza, Raá¹£appa, Kalzi, Isana, BÃªlÃª, Kullania,
Arpadda; these have failed to pay their dues. Raá¹£appa, Bará¸«alza,
Diá¸³uá¸³ina, the chief of the vineyards, Daian-Adadi, Isana, á¸ªalziatbar,
Birtu, Arzuá¸«ina, Arbailu, Guzana, Sharish, Diá¸«nunna, Rimusu, all
these have not given the barley and wheat due from them. And
as to the overseer of the bakehouse, the overseer of the larder and
the chief purveyors, concerning whom the king, my lord, inquired,
they are removed from their posts, and this is alleged as the reason:
The overseer of the bakehouse is a child, Sennacherib removed him;
Ashur-zÃªr-iddin, the priest of Nineveh, slandered him. I was frightened
at the troubles. He had not committed any great crime....
The overseer of the larder had broken (?) a dish of Ashur's, for this
deed thy father removed him from charge of Ashur's dish, and appointed
a turban-maker's son; he is without education. And concerning
the chief purveyors, Sennacherib made a reduction of their
allowances, and the son of the turban-maker receives the rest. Now
for six years he has been dead and his son indeed stands in his office.
Justice has been in abeyance since Sargon. Sennacherib was the remover.

This is according to their reasons. The king, my lord, as
he will, let him do.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The text is difficult, partly because some signs are defaced,
partly because some words could be read more ways than
one, and others are obscure. It seems quite clear that the
cult of Ashur had greatly suffered. We know from the
á¸¤arrÃ¢n census that certain lands were charged with dues
to the temples, others with salaries to officials. The list of
defaulters is of geographical value. The deposition of rightful
temple officers and the intrusion of unworthy substitutes,
on slight grounds, is charged to Sennacherib. He
was evidently estranged from the cult of Ashur. Doubtless
a comparison of other letters will clear up some of the
obscurities, but sufficient is clear to indicate the importance
of such documents.

Evidently the lady Sarai had great influence with the scribe

Marduk-erba is not clear. Perhaps they were sold for some
government claim. It seems that the lady wished to keep
them back, but that the purchaser had called and was about
to take them away, unless the scribe in some way intervened.

The third journey was from DÃ»r-sisite to Maturaba, from
Maturaba to DÃ»r-Taliti. The fourth journey was from
DÃ»r-Taliti to Babiti, from Babiti to Lagabgalagi. The fifth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
journey was from Lagabgalagi to the river RadÃ¢nu, thence
to Asri. The sixth journey was from Asri to Arrakdi.
The seventh journey was from á¸¤ualsundi to Napigi, thence

to DÃ»r-Ashur as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">two kaspu, twenty-four uÅ¡, twenty-four

value for a determination of the Assyrian measures of
length. The distances are correct to the cubit. The eighth

Several words in this text are not found elsewhere, but
very strangely we know much about the persons. Shirá¸³u,
whose other name was Marduk-nÃ¢á¹£ir-aplu, son of IddinÃ¢,
was of the important commercial house of Egibi, and lived
in the reign of Darius. He was a great ship-owner, and had
the tolls of a certain bridge. He travelled to Elam in the
fifth year of Darius. A great many of his business transactions
are detailed by Dr. Pinches.<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> Daian-bÃªl-uá¹£ur and
his wife NanÃ¢-bÃªl-uá¹£ri were slaves of Shirá¸³u, who pledged
them with their six children, at one time. In the sixteenth
year of Darius their master gave them as part of her dowry,
to Amat-Bau, daughter of KalbÃ¢. They lived in the town
of Suppatum.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prologue and epilogue of the Code are very difficult to translate.
Often the phrases are simply stock expressions which occur in
most of the royal inscriptions. The meanings of many of these have
degenerated to mere titles of courtesy and their original significance
is obscure. But early translators found no difficulty in guessing the
most complimentary things to say, and more recent scholars in their
efforts to be exact become grotesque. When an ancient king called
himself a <span class="tei tei-q">ârabid buffaloâ</span> it doubtless gave him satisfaction, but it
would be very rude for us to do so. On the other hand, it is very
tiresome to an English reader to read a sentence of three hundred
lines in length before coming to a principal verb. Such a sentence,
a string of epithets and participles, is here broken up into short
clauses and the participles turned into finite verbs. This is done,
not because the translator is entirely ignorant of grammar, but in
pity for the reader. This further necessitates turning the third person
singular, in which the king speaks of himself, like a modern
acceptance of an invitation to dinner, into the more simple direct
narration in the first person. Anyone who wishes to compare this
translation with the original will please recall that this is done for
ease in understanding, not because the original was misunderstood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A more serious difficulty is, that, as it was customary to apply the
same honorific titles to both a god and the king, it is often uncertain
to which the original meant to apply them. This may have been left
intentionally vague. Some translators have taken on themselves to
settle to which they will refer the epithet, to the god or to the king.
Such translations are only interesting as a record of private opinions.
They settle nothing, do not even give a presumption in favor of
anything. It is more honest to leave the translation as vague as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
original, when this can be done. This part of the stele is full of
rare words, or what is just as bad, words which invariably occur in
the same context. If a king calls himself by some strange honorific
title, it is no assistance to understanding the meaning of it that a
score of successors should do the same. Of many words, all we can
conjecture is that the king was honored by them. There is nothing to
indicate what they really meant. In some cases <span class="tei tei-q">âmightyâ</span> is as
likely to be correct as <span class="tei tei-q">âwise.â</span> There is no reason why we should
prefer either rendering. Both can hardly be right, neither may
really be. Some king may once have prided himself on being an
expert potter, as a modern monarch might on being a photographer.
If he called himself on a monument a <span class="tei tei-q">âsuperb potter,â</span> all his successors
would keep the title, though they never made a pot in their
lives. We have only to peruse the titles of modern monarchs to be
sure of the fact. It is, therefore, to be hoped that no one will build
any far-reaching theories upon logical deductions from the translations
given here or elsewhere of such honorific titles.

Prologue To The Code Of á¸¤ammurabi
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the most high God (Anu), king of the spirits of heaven
(Anunnaki), (and) BÃªl, lord of heaven and earth, who settles the fates of
all, allotted to Marduk, the first-born of Ea, the lord God of right,
a rule over men and extolled him among the spirits of earth (Igigi),
then they nominated for Babylon a name above all, they made it
renowned in all quarters, and in the midst of it they founded an
everlasting sovereignty, whose seat is established like heaven and
earth; then did God (Anu) and BÃªl call me by name, á¸¤ammurabi,
the high prince, god-fearing, to exemplify justice in the land, to banish
the proud and oppressor, that the great should not despoil the
weak, to rise like the sun over the black-headed race (mankind) and
illumine the land, to give health to all flesh. á¸¤ammurabi the (good)
shepherd, the choice of BÃªl, am I, the completer of plenty and
abundance, the fulfiller of every purpose. For Nippur, and DÃ»rili
(epithet of Nippur or part of it?), I highly adorned Ã-KUR (the
temple of BÃªl there). In powerful sovereignty I restored Eridu and
cleansed Ã-ZU-AB (temple of Ea there). By onslaughts on every
side (the four quarters) I magnified the name of Babylon and rejoiced
the heart of Marduk my lord. Every day I stood in Ã-SAG-GIL
(the temple of Marduk at Babylon). Descendant of kings whom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sin had begotten, I enriched the city of Ur, and humbly adoring, was
a source of abundance to Ã-NER-NU-GAL (the temple of Sin at Ur).
A king of knowledge, instructed by Shamash the judge, I strongly
established Sippara, reclothed the rear of the shrine of Aya (the
consort of Shamash), and planned out Ã-BAB-BAR (temple of Shamash
at Sippara) like a dwelling in heaven. In arms I avenged Larsa
(held by the Elamite, Rim-Sin), and restored Ã-BAB-BAR (temple of
Shamash at Larsa) for Shamash my helper. As overlord I gave
fresh life to Erech, furnishing abundance of water to its people, and
completed the spire of Ã-AN-NA (temple of NanÃ¢ at Erech). I completed
the glory of Anu and Ninni. As a protector of my land, I
reassembled the scattered people of Nisin (recently reconquered from
the Elamites) and replenished the treasury of Ã-GAL-MAá¸¤ (temple
of Nisin). As the royal potentate of the city and own brother of
its god Zamama, I enlarged the palace at Kish and surrounded with
splendor Ã-ME-TE-UR-SAG (the temple at Kish). I made secure the
great shrine of Ninni. I ordered the temple of á¸¤arsagkalama
Ã-KI-SAL-nakiri, by whose assistance I attained my desire. I restored
Kutha and increased everything at Ã-SID-LAM (the temple there).
Like a charging bull, I bore down my enemies. Beloved of TU-TU (a
name of Marduk) in my love for Borsippa, of high purpose untiring, I
cared for Ã-ZI-DA (temple of NabÃ» there). As a god, king of the
city, knowing and farseeing, I looked to the plantations of Dilbat and
constructed its granaries for IB (the god of Dilbat) the powerful, the
lord of the insignia, the sceptre and crown, with which he invested
me. As the beloved of MA-MA (consort of IB), I set fast the bas-reliefs
at Kish and renewed the holy meals for Erishtu (goddess of
Kish). With foresight and power I ordered the pasturages and
watering-places for Sirpurla and Girsu and arranged the extensive
offerings in Ã-50 (the temple of <span class="tei tei-q">âthe fiftyâ</span> at Sirpurla). I scattered
my enemies. As the favorite of Telitim (a god), I fulfilled the
oracles of á¸¤allab and rejoiced the heart of GIS-DAR (its goddess).
Grand prince, whose prayers Adad knows well, I soothed the heart of
Adad, the warrior in BÃ®t Karkara. I fastened the ornaments in Ã-UD-GAL-GAL
(temple there). As a king who gave life to Adab, I repaired
Ã-MAá¸¤ (temple at Adab). As hero and king of the city,
unrivalled combatant, I gave life to Mashkan-Shabri and poured
forth abundance on SIT-LAM (temple of NÃªrgal there). The wise,
the restorer, who had conquered the whole of the rebellious, I rescued
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the people of MalkÃ¢ in trouble. I strengthened their abodes
with every comfort. For Ea and DAM-GAL-NUN-NA I increased
their rule and in perpetuity appointed the lustrous offerings. As a
leader and king of the city, I made the settlements on the Euphrates
to be populous. As client of Dagan, who begat me, I avenged the
people of Mera and Tutul. As high prince, I made the face of
Ninni to shine, making the lustrous meals of NIN-A-ZU secure. I
reunited my people in famine by assuring their allowances within
Babylon in peace and security. As the shepherd of my people, a
servant whose deeds were acceptable to GIS-DAR in E-UL-MASH (temple
of Anunit) in the midst of Agade, noted for its wide squares, I settled
the rules and set straight the Tigris. I brought back to Asshur the
gracious colossus and settled the altar (?). As king of Nineveh I
made the waters of Ninni to shine in Ã-DUP-DUP. High of purpose
and wise in achievement for the great gods, descendant of Sumu-lÃ¢il,
eldest son of Sin-muballiá¹­, long descended scion of royalty, great
king, a very Shamash (or sun) of Babylon, I caused light to arise
upon Sumer and Akkad. A king who commanded obedience in all
the four quarters, beloved of Ninni am I. When Marduk brought
me to direct all people and commissioned me to give judgment, I laid
down justice and right in the provinces, I made all flesh to prosper.
Thenâ(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the words of the Code are the completion of the sentence.

decision</span></span>).

king, settled, and caused the land to receive a sure polity and a
gracious rule.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am á¸¤ammurabi, the superb king. Marduk gave me to shepherd
the black-headed race, whom BÃªl had assigned me. I did not
forget, I did not neglect, I found for them safe pastures, I opened
the way through sharp rocks, and gave them guidance. With the
powerful weapon that Zamama and Ishtar granted me, by the foresight
with which Ea endowed me, with the power that Marduk gave
me, I cut off the enemy above and below, I lorded it over the
conquered. The flesh of the land I made to rejoice. I extended
the dwellings of the people in security. I left them no cause to
fear. The great gods chose me and I am the shepherd that gives
peace, whose club is straight; of evil and good in my city I was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
director. I carried all the people of Sumer and Akkad in my
bosom. By my protection, I guided in peace its brothers. By my
wisdom, I provided for them. That the great should not oppress
the weak, to counsel the widow and orphan, in Babylon, the city of
Anu and BÃªl, I raised up its head (the stele's) in Ã-SAG-GIL (temple
of Marduk there), the temple whose foundation is firm as the heaven
and earth. To judge the judgment of the land, to decide the decisions
of the land, to succor the injured, I wrote on my stele the
precious words and placed them before my likeness, that of a righteous
king. The king that is gentle, king of the city, exalted am I.
My words are precious, my power has no rival. By the order of
Shamash, the judge supreme, of heaven and earth, that judgment
may shine in the land; by the permission of Marduk, my lord, I
set up a bas-relief, to preserve my likeness in Ã-SAG-GIL that I love,
to commemorate my name forever in gratitude. The oppressed who
has a suit to prosecute may come before my image, that of a righteous
king, and read my inscription and understand my precious
words and may my stele elucidate his case. Let him see the law he
seeks and may he draw in his breath and say: <span class="tei tei-q">âThis á¸¤ammurabi
was a ruler who was to his people like the father that begot them.
He obeyed the order of Marduk his lord, he followed the commands
of Marduk above and below. He delighted the heart of Marduk
his lord, and granted happy life to his people forever. He guided
the land.â</span> Let him recite the document. Before Marduk, my lord,
and á¹¢arpanitum, my lady, with full heart let him draw near. The
colossus and the gods that live in Ã-SAG-GIL, or the courts of
Ã-SAG-GIL, let him bless every day before Marduk, my lord, and á¹¢arpanitum,
my lady.

In the future, in days to come, at any time, let the king who is
in the land, guard the words of righteousness which I have written
on my stele. Let him not alter the judgment of the land which I
judged nor the decisions I decided. Let him not destroy my bas-relief.
If that man has wisdom and is capable of directing his land,
let him attend to the words which I have written upon my stele, let
him apprehend the path, the rule, the law of the land which I judged,
and the decision I decided for the land, and so let him guide forward
the black-headed race; let him judge their judgment and decide
their decision, let him cut off from his land the proud and violent,
let him rejoice the flesh of his people. á¸¤ammurabi, the king of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
righteousness, to whom Shamash has granted rights, am I. My
words are precious, my deeds have no rival. Above and below I
am the whirlwind that scours the deep and the height. If that
man has hearkened to my words which I have written on my stele
and has not frustrated justice, has not altered my words, has
not injured my bas-reliefs, may Shamash make lasting his sceptre;
like me, as a king of righteousness, let him guide his people in
justice.

But if that man does not hearken to my words which I wrote on
my stele, forgets my curses, fears not the malediction of God, sets
aside the judgment which I judged, alters my words and destroys
my bas-reliefs, effaces my inscribed name and writes in his own
name; or, for fear of these curses has charged another to do so; that
man, be he king, lord, patÃªsi, or noble, whose name is ever so renowned,
may the great god (Anu), the father of gods, who named
my reign, turn him back, shatter his sceptre in pieces, curse his fortunes;
may BÃªl the lord who fixes the fates, whose command is not
set aside, who extended my sovereignty, cause for him an endless revolt,
an impulse to fly from his home, and set for his fortune a reign
of sighs, short days, years of want, darkness that has no ray of light
and a death in the sight of all men. May he decree with his heavy
curse the ruin of his city, the scattering of his people, the removal
of his sovereignty, the disappearance of his name and his race from
the land. May Beltu, the great mother, whose command is weighty
in Ã-KUR, the lady who made my plans prosperous, make his words
in the matter of justice and law to be hateful before BÃªl. May she
bring about the downfall of his country, the loss of his people, the
efflux of his life like water, by the order of the BÃªl, the king. May
Ea, the grand prince, whose destiny takes premier rank, the messenger
of the gods, who knows all, who has prolonged my life, distort
his understanding and intellect, curse him with forgetfulness, dam up
his rivers at their source. In his land may Ashnan (the deity of
wheat), the life of the people, not grow. May Shamash, great judge
of heaven and earth, who governs the creatures of life, the lord of
help, cut off his sovereignty; judge not his judgment; carry away
his path; annihilate the march of his armies; cast an evil look upon
him to uproot his rule, and fix for him the loss of his land. May
the evil sentence of Shamash quickly overwhelm him; deprive him
of life among the living above; and below in the earth, deprive his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ghost of water. May Sin, the lord of the sky, the god who creates,
whose ray is splendid among the gods, deprive him of crown and
throne of kinship; surround him with a great shirt of pain, a heavy
penalty, that will not leave his body, and make him finish his days,
month by month, through the years of his reign, in tears and sighs.
May he multiply for him the burden of royalty. May he grant him
as his lot a life that can only be likened to death. May Adad, lord
of abundance, great bull of the sky, and the earth, my helper, withdraw
the rain from the heavens, the floods from the springs; destroy
his land with hunger and want; thunder in wrath over his city, and
turn his land to deluge mounds. May Zamama, great warrior, first
born of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ã-KUR</span></span>, who goes at my right hand on the battlefield,
shatter his weapon and turn for him day into night. May he place his
enemy over him. May Ishtar, the lady of conflict and battle, who
prospered my arms, my gracious protector, who loved my reign, in
her heart of rage, her boundless fury, curse his sovereignty; turn all
his mercies to curses, shatter his weapon in conflict and battle, appoint
him trouble and sedition, strike down his heroes, and make
the earth drink of their blood, scatter the plain with heaps of the
carcasses of his troops, grant them no burial; deliver himself into the
hands of his enemy, cause him to be carried in chains to the enemy's
land. May NÃªrgal, the powerful one of the gods, who meets with
no rival, who caused me to obtain my triumphs, burn up his people
with a fever like a great fire among the reeds. With his powerful
weapon may he drink him up, with his fevers crush him like a statue
of clay. May Erishtu, the exalted lady of all lands, the creator-mother,
carry off his son and leave him no name. May he not beget
a seed of posterity among his people. May Nin-karrak, the daughter
of Anu, the completer of my mercies in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ã-KUR</span></span>, award him a
severe malady, a grievous illness, a painful wound, which cannot be
healed, of which the physician knows not the origin, which cannot
be soothed by the bandage; and rack him with palsy, until she has
mastered his life; may she weaken his strength. May the great
gods of heaven and earth, the Anunnaki, in their assembly, who
look after the halls and the courts of this Ã-bar-ra (temple of
Shamash at Sippara, where the stele was clearly set up), curse with
a bitter curse his dynasty, his land, his soldiers, his people, and his
subjects. May the judgments of BÃªl, which in his mouth are irrevocable,
curse him and quickly overcome him.

The following tables make no pretence to finality. In Babylonian
history no date before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 747 can be considered absolutely
fixed. In Assyrian history the Eponym Canon certainly goes back to
about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 893. Then scattered notices in later writers enable
us to approximate to earlier dates and the varied synchronisms between
Assyrian and Babylonian kings render the dates probable, as far
back as the First Dynasty of Babylon. There is only one fixed date
before that, the period of Sargon I., which depends on a statement
of Nabonidus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sequence of monarchs is, however, very probably correct. As
knowledge increases, more names will be added to fill up the gaps,
and dated documents will give the lengths of the reigns. A discussion
of the grounds for the dates cannot be given here. The reader
may refer to Dr. P. Rost, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mittheilungen der Vorderasiatischen
Gesellschaft</span></span>, 1897, No. 2, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orientalistische

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Early Babylonian History</span></span> may
be consulted for the earliest dates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the early periods, a vertical line between two names denotes
that the second was son of the former. This is often all we know,
but it is useful to mark the fact, as we cannot then insert other
rulers between them. Names printed in capitals are either Sumerian
or their true pronunciation is unknown. When these capitals are
in Roman type, we know that they were kings or Patesis; when they
are printed in italic, we only know that they were the parents of
those whose names follow. We do not then know whether they
reigned or not.

            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
